<h2><span class="larger">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>In the little village of Como, in that province of Northern
Italy called by the Romans &ldquo;Gaul-this-side-the-Alps,&rdquo; was
born, twenty-three years after the coming of our Lord, Caius
Plinius Secundus, known to us by the shorter name of
&ldquo;Pliny.&rdquo; His boyhood was spent in his native province, but
we find him in Rome in his sixteenth year attending the lectures
of Apion, the grammarian. Like Herodotus he became
a great traveller for those days, visiting Africa, Egypt and
Greece, and in his twenty-third year he served in Germany
under Pomponius Secundus, by whom he was greatly beloved,
and was soon promoted to the command of a troop of cavalry.
He appears to have remained in the army, journeying
about extensively in Germany and Gaul, until he was twenty-eight
years old, when he returned to Rome and devoted himself
to the study of law. But his natural taste for literary
work speedily developed itself, and, abandoning his forensic
pursuits, he set to work upon a life of his friend Pomponius
and an account of &ldquo;The Wars in Germany,&rdquo; which filled
twenty books when completed, no part of which is now extant.
In the reign of Nero, Pliny was appointed procurator,
or comptroller of the revenue, in Nearer Spain. During his
absence upon this mission his brother-in-law, Caius C&aelig;cilius,
died, leaving one son, a boy ten years of age, Caius Plinius
C&aelig;cilius Secundus&mdash;afterwards a famous lawyer and the
author of the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;&mdash;whom he adopted immediately
upon his return from Spain, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 70. To this nephew we are
indebted for nearly all we know of Pliny&rsquo;s personal character
and mode of life, a very entertaining description of which he
gives in a letter to his friend, Baebius Macer:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</div>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to find you such a reader of
my uncle&rsquo;s works as to wish to have a complete collection of
them, and to ask me for the names of them all. I will act
as index then, and you shall know the very order in which
they were written, for the studious reader likes to know this.
The first work of his was a treatise in one volume, &lsquo;On the
Use of the Dart by Cavalry;&rsquo; this he wrote when in command
of one of the cavalry corps of our allied troops. It is
drawn up with great care and ingenuity. Next came &lsquo;The
Life of Pomponius Secundus,&rsquo; in two volumes. Pomponius
had a great affection for him, and my uncle thought he owed
this tribute to his memory. &lsquo;The History of the Wars in
Germany&rsquo; was in twenty books, in which he gave an account
of all the battles we were engaged in against that nation. A
dream he had while serving in the army in Germany first
suggested the design of this work to him. He imagined that
Drusus Nero, who extended his conquests very far into that
country, and there lost his life, appeared to him in his sleep,
and entreated him to rescue his memory from oblivion. Next
comes a work entitled &lsquo;The Student,&rsquo; in three parts, which
from their length spread into six volumes: a work in which
is discussed the earliest training and subsequent education of
the orator. His &lsquo;Questions of Latin Grammar and Style,&rsquo; in
eight books, was written in the latter part of Nero&rsquo;s reign,
when the tyranny of the times made it dangerous to engage
in literary pursuits requiring freedom and elevation of tone.
He completed the history which Aufidius Bassus left unfinished,
and added to it thirty books. And lastly he has left
thirty-seven books on <i>Natural History</i>, a work of great compass
and learning, and as full of variety as nature herself.
You will wonder how a man as busy as he was could find
time to compose so many books, and some of them, too, involving
such care and labor. But you will be still more surprised
when you hear that he pleaded at the bar for some
time, that he died in his fifty-sixth year, and that the intervening
<span class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
time was employed partly in the execution of the
highest official duties, and partly in attendance upon those
emperors who honored him with their friendship. But he
had a quick apprehension, marvellous power of application,
and was of an exceedingly wakeful temperament. He always
began to study at midnight at the time of the feast of Vulcan,
not for the sake of good luck, but for learning&rsquo;s sake; in winter
generally at one in the morning, but never later than two,
and often at twelve. He was a most ready sleeper, insomuch
that he would sometimes, whilst in the midst of his studies,
fall off and then wake up again. Before day-break he used to
wait upon Vespasian, who also used his nights for transacting
business in, and then proceed to execute the orders he had
received. As soon as he returned home, he gave what time
was left to study. After a short and light refreshment at
noon, agreeably to the good old custom of our ancestors, he
would frequently in the summer, if he was disengaged from
business, lie down and bask in the sun; during which time
some author was read to him, while he took notes and made
extracts, for out of every book he read he made extracts;
indeed it was a maxim of his, that &lsquo;no book was so bad but
some good might be got out of it.&rsquo; When this was over, he
generally took a cold bath, then some slight refreshment and
a little nap. After this, as if it had been a new day, he
studied till supper-time, when a book was again read to him,
from which he would take down running notes. I remember
once when his reader had mis-pronounced a word, one of my
uncle&rsquo;s friends at the table made him go back to where the
word was and repeat it; upon which my uncle said to his
friend, &lsquo;You understood it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the
other. &lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;did you make him go over it
again? We have lost more than ten lines by this interruption.&rsquo;
Such an economist he was of time! In the summer
he used to rise from supper by daylight, and in winter as
soon as it was dark: a rule he observed as strictly as if it had
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
been a law of the state. Such was his manner of life amid
the bustle and turmoil of the town: but in the country his
whole time was devoted to study, except only when in the
bath. When I say in the bath I mean while he was in the
water, for all the while he was being rubbed and wiped, he
was employed either in hearing some book read to him or in
dictating himself. In going about anywhere, as though he
were disengaged from all other business, he applied his mind
wholly to that single pursuit. Always by his side was a
short-hand<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> writer, with book and tablets, who, in the winter,
wore a particular sort of warm gloves, that the sharpness of
the weather might not occasion any interruption to my
uncle&rsquo;s studies: and for the same reason, when in Rome, he
was always carried in a chair. I recollect his once taking me
to task for walking. &lsquo;You need not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;lose these
hours.&rsquo; For he looked upon every hour as lost that was not
given to study. Through this extraordinary application he
found time to compose the several treatises I have mentioned,
besides one hundred and sixty volumes of extracts which he
left me in his will, consisting of a kind of common-place,
written on both sides, in a very small hand, which renders the
collection doubly voluminous. He used himself to tell us
that when he was comptroller of the revenue in Spain, he
could have sold these manuscripts to Largius Licinus for four
hundred thousand sesterces ($16,000), and then the collection
was not so extensive as now. When you consider the books he
has read, and the volumes he has written, are you not inclined
to suspect that he never was engaged in public duties or was
ever in the confidence of his prince? On the other hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
when you are told how indefatigable he was in his studies,
are you not inclined to wonder that he read and wrote no
more than he did? For, on one side, what obstacles would
not the business of a court throw in his way? and on the
other, what might not such intense application effect? It
amuses me when I hear myself called a studious man, who in
comparison with him am the merest idler. But why do I
mention myself, who am diverted from these pursuits by numberless
affairs both public and private? Who among those
whose whole lives are devoted to literary pursuits would not
blush and feel himself the most confirmed of sluggards by the
side of him? I see I have run out my letter farther than I
had originally intended, which was only to let you know, as
you asked me, what works he had left behind him. But I
trust this will be no less acceptable to you than the books
themselves, as it may, possibly, not only excite your curiosity
to read his works, but also your emulation to copy his example,
by some attempts of a similar nature. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his great work of thirty-seven books upon Natural History&mdash;the
only one which has come down to us&mdash;Pliny has
compiled a vast encyclop&aelig;dia of all human knowledge of his
time, comprising more than <i>twenty thousand subjects</i>, and
necessitating, as he himself states, the perusal of two thousand
volumes&mdash;almost all of which have perished&mdash;the works
of five hundred authors, to which he has added countless matters
derived from his personal enquiry, experience and observation.
Among his enthusiastic admirers in modern times
are the eminent naturalists, Cuvier and Buffon. The former
in less extravagant but equally appreciative terms accords to
Pliny a high place among the writers of classical antiquity.
&ldquo;The work of Pliny,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is one of the most precious
monuments that have come down to us from ancient times,
and affords proof of an astonishing amount of erudition in
one who was a warrior and a statesman. To appreciate with
justice this vast and celebrated composition, it is necessary
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
to regard it in several points of view&mdash;with reference to the
plan proposed, the facts stated, and the style employed. The
plan proposed by the writer is of immense extent&mdash;it is his
object to write not simply a Natural History in our restricted
sense of the term, not an account merely, more or less detailed,
of animals, plants, and minerals, but a work which
embraces astronomy, physics, geography, agriculture, commerce,
medicine, and the fine arts&mdash;and all these in addition
to natural history properly so called; while at the same time
he continually interweaves with his narrative information
upon the arts which bear relation to man considered metaphysically,
and the history of nations,&mdash;so much so indeed,
that in many respects this work was the Encyclop&aelig;dia of its
age. It was impossible in running over, however cursorily,
such a prodigious number of subjects, that the writer should
not have made us acquainted with a multitude of facts, which,
while remarkable in themselves, are the more precious from
the circumstance that at the present day he is the only author
extant who relates them. It is to be regretted however that
the manner in which he has collected and grouped this mass
of matter, has caused it to lose some portion of its value,
from his mixture of fable with truth. But if Pliny possesses
little merit as a critic, it is far otherwise with his talent as a
writer, and the immense treasury which he opens to us of
Latin terms and forms of expression: these, from the very
abundance of the subjects upon which he treats, render his
work one of the richest repositories of the Roman language.
Wherever he finds it possible to give expression to general
ideas or to philosophical views, his language assumes considerable
energy and vivacity, and his thoughts present to us a
certain novelty and boldness which tend in a very great degree
to relieve the dryness of his enumerations, and, with the
majority of his readers, excuse the insufficiency of his scientific
indications. He is always noble and serious, full of the
love of justice and virtue, detestation of cruelty and baseness,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
of which he had such frightful instances before his eyes, and
contempt for that unbridled luxury which in his time had so
deeply corrupted the Roman people. For these great merits
Pliny cannot be too highly praised, and despite the faults
which we are obliged to admit in him when viewed as a naturalist,
we are bound to regard him as one of the most meritorious
of the Roman writers, and among those most worthy
to be reckoned in the number of the classics who wrote after
the reign of Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the later honors conferred upon Pliny was one
which indirectly cost him his life&mdash;his appointment by Vespasian,
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 74, as prefect of the Roman fleet on the west
coast of Italy. Three years later, in the great eruption of
Mt. Vesuvius and the destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii,
he met his romantic end in the execution of his duty,
the story of which is again graphically told by the younger
Pliny in two letters to his friend Tacitus the historian:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your request that I would send you an account of my
uncle&rsquo;s death, in order to transmit a more exact relation of
it to posterity, deserves my acknowledgments; for, if this
accident shall be celebrated by your pen, the glory of it, I am
well assured, will be rendered forever illustrious. And notwithstanding
he perished by a misfortune, which, as it involved
at the same time a most beautiful country in ruins,
and destroyed so many populous cities, seems to promise him
an everlasting remembrance notwithstanding he has himself
composed many and lasting works; yet I am persuaded, the
mentioning of him in your immortal writings, will greatly
contribute to render his name immortal. Happy I esteem
those to be to whom by provision of the gods has been
granted the ability either to do such actions as are worthy of
being related or to relate them in a manner worthy of being
read. My uncle was at that time with the fleet under his
command at Misenum, in the Bay of Naples. On the 24th
of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired
<span class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
him to observe a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size
and shape. He had just taken a turn in the sun, and, after
bathing himself in cold water, and making a light luncheon,
had gone back to his books: he immediately arose and went
out upon a piece of rising ground, where he could get a better
sight of this very uncommon appearance. A cloud was ascending
from a mountain, afterwards found to be Vesuvius,
the appearance of which I cannot more accurately describe
than by likening it to that of a pine tree, for it shot up to a
great height in the form of a very tall trunk, spreading itself
out at the top into a sort of branch. It appeared sometimes
bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was
either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
This phenomenon seemed to a man of such learning and research
as my uncle extraordinary and worth further looking
into. He accordingly ordered a light vessel to be got ready,
and gave me leave, if I liked, to accompany him. I preferred
to go on with my work; and it so happened that he
had himself given me something to write out. Just as he
was coming out of the house, tablets in hand, he received a
note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was in the utmost
alarm at the imminent danger which threatened her; as her
villa lay at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, there was no way of
escape but by sea; she earnestly entreated him therefore to
come to her assistance. So he changed his first intention,
and what he had begun from a philosophical, he now carried
out in a noble and generous spirit. He ordered the galleys
to put to sea, and went himself on board with an intention
of assisting not only Rectina, but the several other towns
which lay thickly strewn along that beautiful coast. Hastening
then to the place from which others were fleeing in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
utmost terror, he steered his course direct to the point of
danger, and with so much calmness and presence of mind as
to be able to make and dictate his observations upon all the
phenomena of that dreadful scene. He was now so close to
the mountain that the cinders, which grew thicker and hotter
the nearer he approached, fell into the ships, together with
pumice-stones, and great black pieces of burning rock: they
were in danger of getting aground by the sudden retreat of
the sea, as well as from the vast fragments which rolled
down from the mountain, and obstructed all the shore. Here
for a moment he stopped to consider whether or not he
should turn back; but when the pilot advised him to do
so, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Fortune favors the brave; steer to Pomponianus.&rsquo;
Pomponianus was at Stabiae (now called Castelamare),
separated by a bay, which the sea, after several
insensible windings, forms with the shore. He had already
sent his baggage on board the ships, for though he was
not at that time in actual danger, yet being within sight
of it, and extremely near, he determined, if it should in the
least increase, to put to sea as soon as the wind, which was
blowing dead in-shore, should go down. It was favorable,
however, for carrying my uncle to Pomponianus, whom he
found in the greatest consternation: he embraced him tenderly,
encouraging and urging him to keep his spirits, and,
the more effectually to soothe his fears by seeming unconcerned
himself, ordered a bath to be got ready, bathed and
sat down to supper with great cheerfulness, or at least, what
is just as heroic, with every appearance of it. Meanwhile
broad flames shone out in several places from Mount Vesuvius,
which the darkness of the night contributed to render
still brighter and clearer. My uncle, to soothe the apprehensions
of his friend, assured him that it was only the burning
of the villages, which the country people had abandoned
to the flames: after this he retired to rest, and was so little
disquieted as to fall into a sound sleep: for his breathing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
which, on account of his corpulence, was rather heavy and
sonorous, was heard by the attendants outside. The court
which led to his apartment was now almost filled with stones
and ashes, and if he had continued there any longer, it would
have been impossible for him to have made his way out. So
he was awakened, and getting up, went to Pomponianus and
the rest of his company, who were feeling too anxious to
think of sleep. They consulted together whether it would be
most prudent to trust to the houses, which now rocked from
side to side with frequent and violent concussions as though
shaken from their very foundations; or fly to the open fields,
where the calcined stones and cinders, though light, fell in
such large showers as to threaten destruction. In this choice
of dangers they resolved for the fields: but I must say that
while the rest of the company were hurried into this resolution
by their fears, my uncle embraced it upon cool and deliberate
consideration. They tied pillows upon their heads
with napkins, and went out, and this was their whole defence
against the storm of stones that fell round them. It was now
day everywhere else, but there a deeper darkness prevailed
than in the thickest night, alleviated, however, in some degree
by torches and other lights of various kinds. They thought
proper to go farther down upon the shore to see if they might
safely put out to sea, but found the waves still running extremely
high and boisterous. There my uncle, laying himself
down upon a sail-cloth, which was spread for him, called
twice for some cold water, which he drank, when immediately
the flames, preceded by a strong whiff of sulphur, dispersed
the rest of the party, and obliged him to rise. He raised
himself up with the assistance of two of his servants, and
instantly fell down dead; suffocated, as I conjecture, by the
noxious vapor, having always had a weak throat, which was
often inflamed. As soon as it was light again, which was not
till the third day after this melancholy accident, his body was
found untouched and without any marks of violence upon it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
in the dress in which he fell, and looking more like a man
asleep than dead. During all this time my mother and I were
at Misenum. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* After my uncle had left us, I spent the
time in my studies until it was the hour for my bath, after
which I went to supper, and then fell into a short and uneasy
sleep. A trembling of the earth had been noticed for many
days before, which did not alarm us much, as this is quite an
ordinary occurrence in Campania; but it was so particularly
violent that night that it not only shook but actually overturned,
as it would seem, everything about us. My mother
rushed into my chamber, where she found me rising in order
to awaken her. We sat down in the open court of the house,
which occupied a small space between the buildings and the
sea. As I was at that time but eighteen years of age, I know
not whether I should call my behavior, in this dangerous
juncture, courage or folly; but I took up Livy, and amused
myself turning over that author, and even making extracts
from him, as if I had been perfectly at my leisure. Just then,
a friend of my uncle&rsquo;s, who had lately come to him from
Spain, joined us, and observing me sitting by my mother
with a book in my hand, reproved her for her calmness, and
me at the same time for my careless security: nevertheless I
went on with my author. Though it was now morning, the
light was still exceedingly faint and doubtful; the buildings
all around us tottered, and though we stood upon open
ground, yet as the place was narrow and confined, it was not
possible to remain without imminent danger: we therefore
resolved to quit the town. A panic-stricken crowd followed
us, and, as to a mind distracted with terror every suggestion
seems more prudent than its own, pressed on us in dense
array to drive us forward as we came out. When at a convenient
distance from the house, we stopped in the midst of
a most dangerous and dreadful scene. The chariots, which
we had ordered to be drawn out, were so agitated backwards
and forwards, though upon the most level ground, that we
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>
could not keep them steady, even by supporting them with
large stones. The sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and
to be driven from its banks by the convulsive motion of the
earth; it is certain at least that the shore was considerably
enlarged, and several sea animals were left upon it. On the
other side, a dreadful black cloud, broken with rapid, zigzag
flashes, revealed behind it variously shaped masses of flame:
these last were like sheet-lightning, but much larger. Upon
this our Spanish friend, whom I mentioned above, addressing
himself to my mother with great energy and urgency, said:
&lsquo;If your brother be safe, he certainly wishes you may be so
too: and if he has perished, it was his desire, no doubt, that
you might both survive him: so why do you delay your
escape a moment?&rsquo; &lsquo;We could never think of our own
safety,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;while we are uncertain of his.&rsquo; Upon this
our friend left us, and withdrew from the danger with the
utmost precipitation. Soon afterwards, the cloud began to
descend, and cover the sea. It had already surrounded and
concealed the island of Capri and the promontory of Misenum.
My mother now besought, urged, even commanded
me to make my escape at any rate, which, as I was young, I
might easily do; as for herself, she said, her age and corpulency
rendered all attempts of that sort impossible; however,
she would willingly meet death if she could have the satisfaction
of seeing that she was not the occasion of mine. But I
absolutely refused to leave her, and, taking her by the hand,
compelled her to go with me. She complied with great
reluctance, and not without many reproaches to herself for
retarding my flight. The ashes now began to fall upon us,
though in no great quantity. I looked back; a dense, dark
mist seemed to be following us, spreading itself over the
country like a cloud. &lsquo;Let us turn out of the high-road,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;while we can still see, for fear that, should we fall in
the road, we should be pressed to death in the dark, by the
crowds that are following us.&rsquo; We had scarcely sat down
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
when night came upon us, not such as we have when the sky
is cloudy, or when there is no moon, but that of a room when
it is shut up, and all the lights put out. You might hear the
shrieks of women, the screams of children, and the shouts
of men; some calling for their children, others for their parents,
others for their husbands, and seeking to recognize each
other by the voices that replied; one lamenting his own fate,
another that of his family; some wishing to die, from the
very fear of dying; some lifting their hands to the gods; but
the greater part convinced that there were now no gods at
all, and that the final, endless night of which we have heard
had come upon the world.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Some augmented the real terrors
by others imaginary or wilfully invented. I remember
some who declared that one part of Misenum had fallen, and
that another was on fire; it was false, but they found people
to believe them. It now grew rather lighter, which we imagined
to be not the forerunner of an approaching burst of
flames, as in truth it was, but the return of day: however, the
fire fell at a distance from us: then we were immersed again
in thick darkness, and a heavy shower of ashes rained upon
us, which we were obliged every now and then to stand up to
shake off, otherwise we should have been crushed and buried
in the heap. I might boast that, during all this scene of
horror, not a sigh or expression of fear escaped me, for my
support was grounded in that miserable, though mighty consolation,
that all mankind were involved in the same calamity,
and that I was perishing with the world itself. At last this
dreadful darkness was dissipated by degrees, like a cloud or
smoke; the real day returned, and even the sun shone out,
though with a lurid light, as when an eclipse is coming on.
Every object that presented itself to our eyes, now extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
weakened, seemed changed, being covered deep with ashes
as with snow. We returned to Misenum, where we refreshed
ourselves as well as we could, and passed an anxious night
between hope and fear; though with a much larger share of
the latter; for the earthquake still continued, and many frenzied
persons ran up and down heightening their own and
their friends&rsquo; calamities by terrible predictions. However,
my mother and I, notwithstanding the danger we had passed,
and that which still threatened us, had no thoughts of leaving
the place, till we could receive some news of my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, please read this narrative without any view of
inserting it in your history, of which it is not in the least
worthy; indeed, you must lay it to your own request if my
account does not appear worth even the trouble of a letter.
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the preparation of the most interesting parts of Pliny&rsquo;s
Natural History for younger readers, I have had constant recourse
for foot-notes to the annotations of those devoted students
of Pliny&mdash;Cuvier, Bostock, and Ajasson, whose work
can rarely be improved upon. The literal rendering of the
original Latin text has been closely followed, and in all instances
where the author&rsquo;s statements have proved in the
light of modern science to be erroneous (unless evidently
preposterous) attention has been called to the fact.</p>
<p>With this volume I reluctantly bring to completion the
brief series of classical authors best adapted for the reading
of boys and girls, in the preparation of which the greater part
of my leisure hours during the past three years has been occupied.
Plutarch, Herodotus, Pliny&mdash;a trio of illustrious
names! Of how many can it be truly said, as of them, the
world is wiser and better for their living?</p>

<br />DEDICATION.</h2>
<h2 id="c1">CAIUS PLINIUS SECUNDUS TO HIS FRIEND TITUS VESPASIAN.</h2>
<p>This treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Roman
literature, which I have just completed, I have taken the liberty
to dedicate to you, most gracious Emperor, an appellation
peculiarly suitable to you, while, on account of his age,
that of <i>great</i> is more appropriate to your Father;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For still thou ne&rsquo;er wouldst quite despise</p>
<p class="t">The trifles that I write;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>if I may be allowed to shelter myself under the example of
Catullus, my fellow-countryman. For he, as you know, when
his napkins<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> had been changed, expressed himself a little
harshly, from his anxiety to show his friendship for his dear
little Veranius and Fabius. At the same time this importunity
of mine may effect, what you complained of my not having
done in another too forward epistle of mine; it will put
upon record, and let all the world know, with what kindness
you exercise the imperial dignity. You have had the honor
of a triumph, and of the censorship, have been six times consul,
and have shared in the tribunate; and, what is still more
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
honorable, whilst you have held them in conjunction with
your Father, you have presided over the Equestrian order,
and been the Prefect of the Pr&aelig;torians: all this you have
done for the service of the Republic, and, at the same time,
have regarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor
has the extent of your prosperity produced any change in
you, except that it has given you the power of doing good
to the utmost of your wishes. And whilst all these circumstances
increase the veneration which other persons feel for
you, with respect to myself, they have made me so bold, as
to wish to become more familiar. You must, therefore,
blame yourself for any fault of this kind that I may commit.</p>
<p>But, although I have laid aside my blushes, I have not
gained my object; for you still awe me, and keep me at a
distance, by the majesty of your understanding. In no one
does the force of eloquence and of tribunitian oratory blaze
out more powerfully! With what glowing language you
thunder forth the praises of your Father! How dearly you
love your Brother! How admirable is your talent for poetry!
What a fertility of genius you possess, so as to enable you to
imitate your Brother! But who is there that is bold enough
to form an estimate on these points, if he is to be judged by
you, and, more especially, if you are challenged to do so?
For the case of those who merely publish their works is very
different from that of those who expressly dedicate them to
you. In the former case I might say, Emperor! why do you
read these things? They are written only for the common
people, for farmers or mechanics, or for those who have nothing
else to do; why do you trouble yourself with them?
Indeed, when I undertook this work, I did not expect that
you would sit in judgment upon me; I considered your situation
much too elevated for you to descend to such an office.
Besides, we possess the right of openly rejecting the opinion
of men of learning. Marcus Tullius Cicero himself, whose
genius is beyond all competition, uses this privilege; and,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
remarkable as it may appear, employs an advocate in his own
defence:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not write for very learned people; I do not
wish my works to be read by Manius Persius, but by Junius
Congus.&rdquo; And if Lucilius, who first introduced the satirical
style, applied such a remark to himself, and if Cicero thought
proper to borrow it, and that more especially in his treatise
&ldquo;De Republica,&rdquo; how much reason have I to do so, who have
such a judge to defend myself against! And by this dedication
I have deprived myself of the benefit of challenge; for
it is a very different thing whether a person has a judge
given him by lot, or whether he voluntarily selects one; and
we always make more preparation for an invited guest, than
for one that comes in unexpectedly.</p>
<p>I am well aware, that, placed as you are in the highest station,
and gifted with the most splendid eloquence and the
most accomplished mind, even those who come to pay their
respects to you, do it with a kind of veneration: on this
account I ought to be careful that what is dedicated to you
should be worthy of you. But the country people, and,
indeed, some whole nations offer milk to the Gods, and those
who cannot procure frankincense substitute in its place salted
cakes; for the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are worshipped
by every one to the best of his ability. But my temerity
will appear the greater by the consideration, that these
volumes, which I dedicate to you, are of such inferior importance.
For they do not admit of the display of genius, nor,
indeed, is mine one of the highest order; they admit of no
excursions, nor orations, nor discussions, nor of any wonderful
adventures to tickle the fancy of the reader. The nature
of things, and life as it actually exists, are described in them;
and often the lowest department of it; so that, in very many
cases, I am obliged to use rude and foreign, or even barbarous
terms, and these often require to be introduced by a kind
of preface. And, besides this, my road is not a beaten track,
nor one which the mind is much disposed to travel over.
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
There is no one among us who has ever attempted it, nor is
there any one individual among the Greeks who has treated
of all the topics. Most of us seek for nothing but amusement
in our studies, while others are fond of subjects that are
of excessive subtilty, and completely involved in obscurity.
My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks
include in the Encyclop&aelig;dia, which, however, are either not
generally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious
conceits. And there are other matters which many writers
have given so much in detail that we quite loathe them. It
is, indeed, no easy task to give novelty to what is old, and
authority to what is new; brightness to what is become tarnished,
and light to what is obscure; to render what is
slighted acceptable, and what is doubtful worthy of our confidence;
to give to all a natural manner, and to each its
peculiar nature. It is sufficiently honorable and glorious to
have been willing even to make the attempt, although it
should prove unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I have included in thirty-six books twenty thousand topics,
all worthy of attention, gained by the careful perusal of one
hundred select authors, and of about two thousand volumes,
of which a few only are in the hands of the studious, on
account of the obscurity of the subjects. To these I have
made considerable additions of things, which were either not
known to my predecessors, or which have been lately discovered.
Nor can I doubt but that there still remain many
things which I have omitted; for I am a mere mortal, and
one that has many occupations. I have, therefore, been
obliged to compose this work at interrupted intervals, by
night as well as by day, so that you will find that I have not
been idle even during this period. The day I devote to you,
exactly portioning out my sleep to the necessity of my health,
and contenting myself with this reward, that while we are
musing on these subjects, as Varro says, we are adding to the
length of our lives; for life properly consists in being awake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>I consider it to be courteous and to indicate an ingenuous
modesty, to acknowledge the sources whence we have derived
assistance, and not to act as most of those have done whom I
have examined. For I must inform you, that in comparing
various authors with each other, I have discovered, that some
of the latest and most dignified writers have transcribed, word
for word, from former works, without making any acknowledgment;
not avowedly rivalling them, in the manner of
Virgil, or with the candor of Cicero, who, in his treatise &ldquo;De
Republica,&rdquo; professes to coincide in opinion with Plato, and
in his Essay on Consolation for his Daughter, says that he
follows Crantor, and, in his Offices, Pan&aelig;cius; volumes,
which, as you well know, ought not merely to be always in
our hands, but to be learned by heart. For it is surely the
mark of a perverted mind and a bad disposition, to prefer
being caught in a theft to returning what we have borrowed,
especially when we have acquired capital, by usurious interest.</p>
<p>The Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles. One
work they called <span title="K&ecirc;rion" class="g">&Kappa;&eta;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>, which means that it was as sweet as a
honeycomb; another <span title="Keras Amaltheias" class="g">&Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; &Alpha;&mu;&alpha;&lambda;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, or Cornu Copi&aelig;, so that you
might expect to get even a draft of pigeon&rsquo;s milk from it.
Then they have their Flowers, their Muses, Magazines, Manuals,
Gardens, Pictures, and Sketches, all of them titles for
which a man might be tempted even to forfeit his bail. But
when you enter upon the works, O ye Gods and Goddesses!
how full of emptiness! Our duller countrymen have merely
their Antiquities, or their Examples, or their Arts. I think
one of the most humorous of them has his Nocturnal Studies.
Varro, indeed, is not much behind him, when he calls one of
his satires A Trick and a Half,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and another, Turning the
Tables. Diodorus was the first among the Greeks who laid
aside this trifling manner and named his history The Library.
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Apion, the grammarian,&mdash;he whom Tiberius C&aelig;sar called the
Trumpeter of the World, but would rather seem to be the
Bell of the Town-Crier,&mdash;supposed that every one to whom he
inscribed any work would thence acquire immortality. I do
not regret not having given my work a more fanciful title.</p>
<p>That I may not, however, appear to inveigh so completely
against the Greeks, I should wish to be considered under the
same point of view with those inventors of the arts of painting
and sculpture, of whom you will find an account in these
volumes, whose works, although they are so perfect that we
are never satisfied with admiring them, are inscribed with a
temporary title, such as &ldquo;Apelles, or Polycletus, was doing
this;&rdquo; implying that the work was only commenced and still
imperfect, and that the artist might benefit by the criticisms
that were made on it and alter any part that required it, if he
had not been prevented by death. It is also a great mark of
their modesty, that they inscribed their works as if they were
the last which they had executed, and as still in hand at the
time of their death. I think there are but three works of art
which are inscribed positively with the words &ldquo;such a one
executed this;&rdquo; of these I shall give an account in the proper
place. In these cases it appears, that the artist felt the most
perfect satisfaction with his work, and certainly these pieces
have excited the envy of every one.</p>
<p>I freely admit, that much may be added to my works; not
only to this, but to all which I have published. By this admission
I hope to escape from the carping critics, and I have
the more reason to say this, because I hear that there are
certain Stoics and Logicians, and also Epicureans (from the
Grammarians I expected as much), who are virulent against
the little work I published on Grammar.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> But I well know,
that even a woman once wrote against Theophrastus, a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
so eminent for his eloquence that he obtained from it his
name, which signifies the Divine<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Speaker.</p>
<p>Because the public good requires that you should be
spared as much as possible from all trouble, I have subjoined
to this epistle the contents of each of the following books,
and have used my best endeavors to prevent your being
obliged to read them all through. And this, which was done
for your benefit, will also serve the same purpose for others,
so that any one may search for what he wishes, and may
know where to find it. This has been already done among
us by Valerius Soranus, in his work which he entitled &ldquo;On
Mysteries.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="larger">Book II.</span>
<br />AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORLD AND THE ELEMENTS.</h2>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />THE CHARACTER AND FORM OF THE WORLD.</h2>
<p>The world,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> and whatever that be which we otherwise call
the heavens, by the vault of which all things are enclosed, we
must conceive to be a Deity, to be eternal, without bounds,
neither created, nor subject, at any time, to destruction. To
inquire what is beyond it is no concern of man, nor can the
human mind form any conjecture respecting it. It is sacred,
eternal, and without bounds, all in all; indeed including
everything in itself; finite, yet like what is infinite; the most
certain of all things, yet like what is uncertain, externally and
internally embracing all things in itself; it is the work of nature,
and itself constitutes nature.</p>
<p>To go out of this world and to search for what is beyond it
would be madness, perfect madness, as if one who is ignorant
of his own dimensions could ascertain the measure of anything
else, or as if the human mind could see what the world
itself cannot contain.</p>
<p>That the universe has the form of a perfect globe we learn
from the name which has been uniformly given to it, as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
from numerous natural arguments. For not only does a figure
of this kind return everywhere into itself<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> and sustain
itself, also including itself, requiring no adjustments, not sensible
of either end or beginning in any of its parts, and is best
fitted for that motion, with which, as will appear hereafter,
it is continually turning round; but still more, because we
perceive it, by the evidence of the sight, to be, in every part,
convex and central, which could not be the case were it of
any other figure.</p>
<p>The rising and the setting of the sun clearly prove, that
this globe is carried round in the space of twenty-four hours,
in an eternal and never-ceasing circuit, and with incredible
swiftness. I am not able to say, whether the sound caused
by the whirling about of so great a mass be excessive, and,
therefore, far beyond what our ears can perceive, nor, indeed,
whether the resounding of so many stars, all carried along at
the same time and revolving in their orbits, may not produce
a kind of delightful harmony of incredible sweetness.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> To
us, who are in the interior, the world appears to glide
silently along, both by day and by night.</p>
<p>Various circumstances in nature prove to us, that there are
impressed on the heavens innumerable figures of animals and
of all kinds of objects, and that its surface is not perfectly
polished like the eggs of birds, as some celebrated authors
assert. This is evident to the eye; for, in one part, we have
the figure of a wain, in others of a bear, of a bull, and of a
letter;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> while, in the middle of them, over our heads, there
is a white circle.</p>
<p>With respect to the name, I am influenced by the unanimous
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
opinions of all nations. For what the Greeks, from its
being ornamented, have termed <span title="kosmos" class="g">&kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, we, from its perfect and
complete elegance, have termed <i>mundus</i>. The name <i>c&oelig;lum</i>,
no doubt, refers to its being engraved, as it were, with the
stars, as Varro suggests. In confirmation of this idea we
may adduce the Zodiac, in which are twelve figures of animals;
through them it is that the sun has continued his
course for so many ages.</p>
<p>I do not find that any one has doubted that there are four
elements. The highest of these is supposed to be fire, and
hence proceed the eyes of so many glittering stars. The
next is that spirit, which both the Greeks and ourselves call
by the same name, air.</p>
<p>It is by the force of this vital principle, pervading all things
and mingling with all, that the earth, together with the fourth
element, water, is balanced in the middle of space. These
are mutually bound together, each remaining in its appropriate
place by the never-ceasing revolution of the world.</p>
<p>Between this body and the heavens there are suspended, in
this a&euml;rial spirit, seven stars, separated by determinate spaces,
which, on account of their motion, we call planets or wandering
bodies, although, in reality, none are less so. The sun is
carried along in the midst of these, a body of great size and
power, the ruler, not only of the seasons and of the different
climates, but also of the stars themselves and of the heavens.
When we consider his operations, we must regard him as the
life, or rather the mind of the universe, the chief regulator
and the God of nature; he also lends his light to the other
stars. He is most illustrious and excellent, beholding all
things and hearing all things&mdash;qualities which are ascribed to
him exclusively by the prince of poets, Homer.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />OF GOD.</h2>
<p>I consider it, therefore, an indication of human weakness
to inquire into the figure and form of God. For whatever
God be, if there be any God distinct from the world, and
wherever he exists, he is all sense, all sight, all hearing, all
life, all mind, and all within himself. To believe that there
are a number of Gods, derived from the virtues and vices of
man, as Chastity, Concord, Understanding, Hope, Honor,
Clemency, and Fidelity; or, according to the opinion of Democritus,
that there are only two, Punishment and Reward,
indicates still greater folly. Human nature, weak and frail as
it is, mindful of its own infirmity, has made these divisions,
so that every one might have recourse to that which he supposed
himself to stand more particularly in need of. Hence
we find different names employed by different nations; the
inferior deities are arranged in classes, and diseases and
plagues are deified, in consequence of our anxious wish to
propitiate them. It was from this cause that a temple was
dedicated to Fever, at the public expense, on the Palatine
Hill, and that an altar was erected to Good Fortune on the
Esquiline. Hence we may understand how it comes to pass
that there is a greater population of the Celestials than of
human beings, since each individual makes a separate God
for himself, adopting his own Juno and his own Genius.
To suppose that some gods should be old and always gray-headed
and others young and like children, some of a dark
complexion, winged, lame, produced from eggs, living and
dying on alternate days, is puerile and foolish enough. But
it is the height of impudence to imagine that they have contests
and quarrels, and that there are Gods of theft and of
various crimes. To assist man is to be a God; this is the
path to eternal glory. This is the path which the Roman
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
nobles formerly pursued, and this is the path which is now
pursued by the greatest ruler of our age, Vespasian Augustus,
he who has come to the relief of an exhausted empire, as
well as by his sons. The ancient mode of remunerating those
who deserved it was to regard them as Gods. For the names
of all the Gods, as well as of the stars that I have mentioned
above, have been derived from their services to mankind.
And with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, and the rest of the
celestial nomenclature, who does not admit that they have reference
to certain natural phenomena?</p>
<p>But it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all
things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs. Can
we believe, or rather can there be any doubt, that it is not polluted
by such a disagreeable and complicated office? It is
not easy to determine which opinion would be most for the
advantage of mankind, since we observe some who have no
respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to a scandalous
excess. They are slaves to foreign ceremonies; they carry
on their fingers the Gods and the monsters whom they worship;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
they condemn and they lay great stress on certain
kinds of food; they impose on themselves dreadful ordinances,
not even sleeping quietly. They do not marry or
adopt children, or indeed do anything else, without the sanction
of their sacred rites. There are others, on the contrary,
who will cheat in the very Capitol, and will forswear themselves
even by Jupiter Tonans,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> and while these thrive in
their crimes, the others torment themselves with their superstitions
to no purpose.</p>
<p>Among these discordant opinions mankind have discovered
for themselves a kind of intermediate deity, by which our
scepticism concerning God is still increased. For all over the
world, in all places, and at all times, Fortune is the only god
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
whom every one invokes; she alone is spoken of, she alone is
accused and is supposed to be guilty; she alone is in our
thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded with reproaches;
wavering as she is, conceived by the generality of
mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain, variable,
and often favoring the unworthy. To her are referred all
our losses and all our gains, and in casting up the accounts of
mortals she alone balances the two pages of our sheet. We
are so much in the power of chance, that change itself is considered
as a God, and the existence of God becomes doubtful.</p>
<p>But there are others who reject this principle and assign
events to the influence of the stars, and to the laws of our
nativity; they suppose that God, once for all, issues his decrees
and never afterwards interferes. This opinion begins to
gain ground, and both the learned and the unlearned vulgar
are falling into it. Hence we have the admonitions of thunder,
the warnings of oracles, the predictions of sooth-sayers,
and things too trifling to be mentioned, as sneezing and stumbling
with the feet reckoned among omens. The late Emperor
Augustus relates, that he put the left shoe on the wrong
foot, the day when he was near being assaulted by his soldiers.
And such things as these so embarrass improvident mortals,
that among all of them this alone is certain, that there is
nothing certain, and that there is nothing more proud or
more wretched than man. For other animals have no care
but to provide for their subsistence, for which the spontaneous
kindness of nature is all-sufficient; and this one circumstance
renders their lot more especially preferable, that they
never think about glory, or money, or ambition, and, above
all, that they never reflect on death.</p>
<p>The belief, however, that on these points the Gods superintend
human affairs is useful to us, as well as that the punishment
of crimes, although sometimes tardy, from the Deity
being occupied with such a mass of business, is never entirely
remitted. And indeed this constitutes the great comfort in
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
this imperfect state of man, that even the Deity cannot do
everything. For he cannot procure death for himself, even
if he wished it, which, so numerous are the evils of life, has
been granted to man as our chief good. Nor can he make
mortals immortal, or recall to life those who are dead; nor
can he effect, that he who has once lived shall not have lived,
or that he who has enjoyed honors shall not have enjoyed
them; nor has he any influence over past events but to cause
them to be forgotten. And, if we illustrate the nature of our
connection with God by a less serious argument, he cannot
make twice ten not to be twenty, and many other things of
this kind.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD.</h2>
<p>The stadium is equal to one hundred and twenty-five of
our Roman paces, or six hundred and twenty-five feet. Posidonius
supposes that there is a space of not less than forty
stadia around the earth, whence mists, winds and clouds proceed;
beyond this he supposes that the air is pure and liquid,
consisting of uninterrupted light; from the clouded region to
the moon there is a space of two million of stadia, and thence
to the sun of five hundred million. It is in consequence of
this space that the sun, notwithstanding his immense magnitude,
does not burn the earth. Many persons have imagined
that the clouds rise to the height of nine hundred stadia.
These points are not completely made out, and are difficult
to explain; but we have given the best account of them that
has been published.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />OF THE STARS WHICH APPEAR SUDDENLY, OR OF COMETS.</h2>
<p>A few things still remain to be said concerning the world;
for stars are suddenly formed in the heavens themselves; of
these there are various kinds.</p>
<p>The Greeks name these stars <i>comets</i>, we name them Crinit&aelig;,
as if shaggy with bloody locks, and surrounded with
bristles like hair. Some of them have a mane hanging down
from their lower part, like a long beard, some vibrate like a
dart with a very quick motion. It was one of this kind which
the Emperor Titus described in his very excellent poem, as
having been seen in his fifth consulship; and this was the last
of these bodies which has been observed. Some are short
and pointed, of a pale color, and shine like a sword without
any rays; others of an amber color emit a few rays from
their margin only. One kind exhibits the figure of a cask,
appearing convex and emitting a smoky light; another has
the appearance of a horn; it is like the one which was visible
when the Greeks fought at Salamis. Occasionally you see
one like a burning torch; and again one like a horse&rsquo;s mane;
the latter often has a very rapid motion, like a circle revolving
on itself. There is also a white comet, with silver hair, so
brilliant that it can scarcely be looked at, exhibiting, as it
were, the aspect of the Deity in a human form. There are
some also that are shaggy, having the appearance of a fleece,
surrounded by a kind of crown. There was one, where the
appearance of a mane was changed into that of a spear; it
happened in the 109th olympiad, in the 398th year of the
City.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> The shortest time during which any one of them has
been observed to be visible is seven days, the longest one
hundred and eighty days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Rome is the only place in the whole world where there is
a temple dedicated to a comet&mdash;the one which was thought
by the late Emperor Augustus to be auspicious to him, from
its appearing during the games which he was celebrating in
honor of Venus, not long after the death of his father C&aelig;sar.
He expressed his joy in these terms: &ldquo;During the very time
of these games of mine, a hairy star was seen during seven
days, in the part of the heavens which is under the Great
Bear. It rose about the eleventh hour of the day, was very
bright, and was conspicuous in all parts of the earth. The
common people supposed the star to indicate, that the soul of
C&aelig;sar was admitted among the immortal Gods.&rdquo; This is
what he proclaimed in public, but, in secret, he rejoiced at
this auspicious omen, interpreting it as produced for himself;
and, to confess the truth, it really proved a salutary omen for
the world at large.</p>
<p>Some persons suppose that these stars are permanent and
that they move through their proper orbits, but that they are
only visible when they recede from the sun. Others suppose
that they are produced by an accidental vapor together with
the force of fire, and that, from this circumstance, they are
liable to be dissipated.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE DOCTRINE OF HIPPARCHUS ABOUT THE STARS.</h2>
<p>Hipparchus, who can never be sufficiently commended, as
one who more especially proved the relation of the stars to
man, and that our souls are a portion of heaven, discovered a
new star that was produced in his own age, and, by observing
its motions on the day in which it shone, he was led to doubt
whether this does not often happen, that those stars have
motion which we suppose to be fixed. And the same individual
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
attempted, what might seem presumptuous even in a
deity, to number the stars for posterity and to express their
relations by appropriate names; having previously devised
instruments,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> by which he might mark the place and the
magnitude of each individual star. In this way it might be
easily discovered, not only whether they were destroyed or
produced, but whether they changed their relative positions,
and likewise, whether they were increased or diminished; the
heavens being thus left as an inheritance to any one, who
might be found competent to complete his plan.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />OF THE STARS WHICH ARE NAMED CASTOR AND POLLUX.</h2>
<p>I have seen, during the night-watches of the soldiers, a
luminous appearance, like a star, attached to the javelins on
the ramparts. They also settle on the yard-arms and other
parts of ships while sailing, producing a kind of vocal sound,
like that of birds flitting about. When they occur singly
they are mischievous, so as even to sink the vessels, and if
they strike on the lower part of the keel, setting them on fire.
When there are two of them they are considered auspicious,
and are thought to predict a prosperous voyage, as it is said
that they drive away that dreadful and terrific meteor named
Helena. On this account their efficacy is ascribed to Castor
and Pollux, and they are invoked as gods. They also occasionally
shine round the heads of men in the evening,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> which
is considered as predicting something very important. But
there is great uncertainty respecting the cause of all these
things, and they are concealed in the majesty of nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.</h2>
<p>It cannot be denied, that fire proceeding from the stars
which are above the clouds, may fall on them, as we frequently
observe on serene evenings, and that the air is agitated
by the impulse, as darts, when they are hurled, whiz
through the air. And when it arrives at the cloud, a discordant
kind of vapor is produced, as when hot iron is plunged
into water, and a wreath of smoke is evolved. Hence arise
squalls. And if wind or vapor be struggling in the cloud,
thunder is discharged; if it bursts out with a flame, there is a
thunderbolt; if it be long in forcing out its way, it is simply
a flash of lightning. By the latter the cloud is simply rent,
by the former it is shattered. Thunder is produced by the
stroke given to the condensed air, and hence it is that the
fire darts from the chinks of the clouds. It is possible also
that the vapor, which has risen from the earth, being repelled
by the stars, may produce thunder, when it is pent up in a
cloud; nature restraining the sound whilst the vapor is struggling
to escape; but when it does escape, the sound bursting
forth, as is the case with bladders that are distended with air.
It is possible also that the spirit, whatever it be, may be
kindled by friction, when it is so violently projected. It is
possible that, by the dashing of the two clouds, the lightning
may flash out, as is the case when two stones are struck
against each other.</p>
<p>We have accounts of many different kinds of thunderbolts.
Those which are dry do not burn objects, but dissipate
them; while those which are moist do not burn, but
blacken them. There is a third kind, which is called bright
lightning, of a very wonderful nature, by which casks are
emptied, without the vessels themselves being injured, or
there being any other trace left of their operation. Gold,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
copper, and silver are melted, while the bags which contain
them are not in the least burned, nor even the wax seal much
defaced. Among the prognostics which took place at the
time of Catiline&rsquo;s conspiracy, Marcus Herennius, a magistrate
of the borough of Pompeii, was struck by lightning when the
sky was without clouds.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="large">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />NATURE OF THE EARTH.</h2>
<p>Next comes the earth, on which alone of all parts of nature
we have bestowed the name that implies maternal veneration.
It is appropriated to man as the heavens are to God. She
receives us at our birth, nourishes us when born, and ever
afterwards supports us; lastly, embracing us in her bosom
when we are rejected by the rest of nature, she then covers us
with especial tenderness; rendered sacred to us, inasmuch as
she renders us sacred, bearing our monuments and titles, continuing
our names, and extending our memory, in opposition
to the shortness of life. In our anger we imprecate her on
those who are now no more, as if we were ignorant that she
is the only being who can never be angry with man. The
water passes into showers, is concreted into hail, swells into
rivers, is precipitated in torrents; the air is condensed into
clouds, rages in squalls; but kind, mild, and indulgent earth,
always ministering to the wants of mortals, how many things
do we compel her to produce spontaneously! What odors
and flowers, nutritive juices, forms and colors! With what
good faith does she render back all that has been entrusted to
her! It is the vital spirit which must bear the blame of producing
noxious animals; for the earth is constrained to receive
the seeds of them, and to support them when they are
produced. The fault lies in the evil nature which generates
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
them. The earth will no longer harbor a serpent after it has
attacked any one, and thus she even demands punishment in
the name of those who are indifferent about it themselves.
She pours forth a profusion of medicinal plants, and is always
producing something for the use of man.</p>
<p>But it must be acknowledged, that everything which the
earth has produced, as a remedy for our evils, we have converted
into the poison of our lives. For do we not use iron,
which we cannot do without, for this purpose? But although
this cause of mischief has been produced, we ought not to
complain; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one part of
nature. How many luxuries and how many insults does she
not bear for us! She is cast into the sea, and, in order that
we may introduce seas into her bosom, she is washed away
by the waves. She is continually tortured for her iron, her
timber, stone, fire, corn, and is even much more subservient
to our luxuries than to our mere support. What indeed she
endures on her surface might be tolerated, but we penetrate
also into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold and silver,
and the ores of copper and lead; we also search for gems and
certain small pebbles, driving our trenches to a great depth.
We tear out her entrails in order to extract the gems with
which we may load our fingers. How many hands are worn
down that one little joint may be ornamented! If the infernal
regions really existed, certainly these burrows of avarice
and luxury would have penetrated into them. And truly we
wonder that this same earth should have produced anything
noxious! But, I suppose, the savage beasts protect her and
keep off our sacrilegious hands. For do we not dig among
serpents and handle poisonous plants along with those veins
of gold? But the Goddess shows herself more propitious to
us, inasmuch as all this wealth ends in crimes, slaughter, and
war, and that, while we drench her with our blood, we cover
her with unburied bones; and being covered with these and
her anger being thus appeased, she conceals the crimes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
mortals. I consider the ignorance of her nature as one of
the evil effects of an ungrateful mind.</p>
<p>Every one agrees that it has the most perfect figure. We
always speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it to be a
globe bounded by the poles. It has not indeed the form of
an absolute sphere, from the number of lofty mountains and
flat plains; but if the termination of the lines be bounded by
a curve, this would compose a perfect sphere. And this we
learn from arguments drawn from the nature of things,
although not from the same considerations which we made
use of with respect to the heavens. For in these the hollow
convexity everywhere bends on itself, and leans upon the
earth as its centre. Whereas the earth rises up solid and
dense, like something that swells up and is protruded outwards.
The heavens bend towards the centre, while the earth
goes from the centre, the continual rolling of the heavens
about it forcing its immense globe into the form of a sphere.</p>
<p>On the question whether there be antipodes there is a
great contest between the learned and the vulgar. We maintain,
that there are men dispersed over every part of the
earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each
other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of
them, and that they, all of them, appear to tread equally on
the middle of the earth. If any one should ask, why those
situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return,
whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do
not fall. But I may make a remark, that will appear plausible
even to the most unlearned, that if the earth were of the
figure of an unequal globe, like the seed of a pine, still it may
be inhabited in every part.</p>
<p>But of how little moment is this, when we have another
miracle rising up to our notice! The earth itself is pendent
and does not fall with us; it is doubtful whether this be from
the force of the spirit which is contained in the universe, or
whether it would fall did not nature resist, by allowing of no
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
place where it might fall. For as the seat of fire is nowhere
but in fire, nor of water except in water, nor of air except in
air, so there is no situation for the earth except in itself,
everything else repelling it. It is indeed wonderful that it
should form a globe, when there is so much flat surface of
the sea and of the plains. And this was the opinion of
Dic&aelig;archus, a peculiarly learned man, who measured the
heights of mountains, under the direction of the kings, and
estimated Pelion, which was the highest, at one thousand two
hundred and fifty paces perpendicular, and considered this as
not affecting the round figure of the globe. But this appears
to me to be doubtful, as I well know that the summits of
some of the Alps rise up by a long space of not less than fifty
thousand paces. But what the vulgar most strenuously contend
against is, to be compelled to believe that the water is
forced into a rounded figure; yet there is nothing more obvious
to the sight among the phenomena of nature. For we see
everywhere, that drops, when they hang down, assume the
form of small globes, and when they are covered with dust, or
have the down of leaves spread over them, they are observed
to be completely round; and when a cup is filled, the liquid
swells up in the middle. But on account of the subtile nature
of the fluid and its inherent softness, the fact is more easily
ascertained by our reason than by our sight. And it is even
more wonderful, that if a very little fluid only be added to a
cup when it is full, the superfluous quantity runs over,
whereas the contrary happens if we add a solid body, even as
much as would weigh twenty denarii. The reason of this is,
that what is dropt in raises up the fluid at the top, while
what is poured on it slides off from the projecting surface.
It is from the same cause that the land is not visible from the
body of a ship when it may be seen from the mast; and that
when a vessel is receding, if any bright object be fixed to the
mast, it seems gradually to descend and finally to become
invisible. And the ocean, which we admit to be without
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
limits, if it had any other figure, could it cohere and exist
without falling, there being no external margin to contain
it?</p>
<p>We must believe, that the great artist, Nature, has so
arranged it, that as the arid and dry earth cannot subsist by
itself and without moisture, nor, on the other hand, can the
water subsist unless it be supported by the earth, they are
connected by a mutual union. The earth opens her harbors,
while the water pervades the whole earth, within, without,
and above; its veins running in all directions, like connecting
links, and bursting out on even the highest ridges; where,
forced up by the air, and pressed out by the weight of the
earth, it shoots forth as from a pipe, and is so far from being
in danger of falling, that it bounds up to the highest and
most lofty places. Hence the reason is obvious, why the seas
are not increased by the daily accession of so many rivers.</p>
<p>The earth has, therefore, the whole of its globe girt, on
every side, by the sea flowing round it. And this is not a
point to be investigated by arguments, but what has been
ascertained by experience.</p>
<p>The globe is divided into five parts, termed zones, and
all that portion is subject to severe cold and perpetual frost,
which is under the two extremities, about each of the poles,
the nearer of which is called the north, and the opposite the
south, pole. The middle of the earth, over which is the
orbit of the sun, is parched and burned by the flame, and is
consumed by being so near the heat. There are only two of
the zones which are temperate, those which lie between the
torrid and the frigid zones, and these are separated from each
other, in consequence of the scorching heat of the heavenly
bodies. It appears, therefore, that the heavens take from us
three parts of the earth; how much the ocean steals is uncertain.
The curve of the globe both reveals and conceals
different objects from the inhabitants of its different parts.
If the earth had been flat, everything would have been seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
at the same time, from every part of it, and the nights would
not have been unequal; while the equal intervals of twelve
hours, which are now observed only in the middle of the
earth, would in that case have been the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Hence it is that there is not any one night and day the
same, in all parts of the earth, at the same time; the intervention
of the globe producing night, and its turning round producing
day.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="large">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />ITALY.</h2>
<p>I am by no means unaware that I may be justly accused of
ingratitude and indolence, if I describe briefly and in a cursory
manner the land which is at once the foster-child and
the parent of all lands; chosen by the providence of the Gods
to render even heaven itself more glorious,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> to unite the
scattered empires of the earth, to bestow a polish upon men&rsquo;s
manners, to unite the discordant and uncouth dialects of so
many different nations by the powerful ties of one common
language, to confer the enjoyments of discourse and of civilization
upon mankind, to become, in short, the mother-country
of all nations of the Earth.</p>
<p>But how shall I commence this undertaking? So vast is
the number of celebrated places (what man living could enumerate
them all?), and so great the renown attached to each
individual nation and subject, that I feel myself quite at a
loss. The city of Rome alone, which forms a portion of it, a
face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous, how large a work
would it require for an appropriate description! And then,
too, the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself! so blest
with natural beauties and opulence, that it is evident that
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
when nature formed it she took a delight in accumulating all
her blessings in a single spot&mdash;how am I to do justice to it?
And then the climate, with its eternal freshness and so replete
with health and vitality, the sereneness of the weather so
enchanting, the fields so fertile, the hillsides so sunny, the
thickets so free from every danger, the groves so cool and
shady, the forests with a vegetation so varying and so luxuriant,
the breezes descending from so many a mountain, the
fruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcendent;
its flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks
so sinewy, its lakes recurring in never-ending succession, its
numerous rivers and springs which refresh it with their waters
on every side, its seas so many in number, its havens and the
bosom of its lands opening everywhere to the commerce of
all the world, and eagerly stretching forth into the very midst
of the waves, for the purpose of aiding as it were the endeavors
of mortals!</p>
<p>For the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its manners,
its men, and the nations whom it has conquered by
eloquence and force of arms. The very Greeks themselves,
a race fond in the extreme of expatiating on their own
praises, have amply given judgment in its favor, when they
named but a small part of it &lsquo;Magna Gr&aelig;cia.&rsquo; But we must
be content to do on this occasion as we have done in our
description of the heavens; we must only touch upon some of
these points, and take notice of but a few of its stars. I only
beg my readers to bear in mind that I am thus hastening on
for the purpose of giving a general description of everything
that is known to exist throughout the whole earth.</p>
<p>I may premise by observing that this land very much
resembles in shape an oak leaf, being much longer than it is
broad; towards the top it inclines to the left, while it terminates
in the form of an Amazonian buckler, in which the spot
at the central projection is the place called Cocinthos, while
it sends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
bays, Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium on the left. It
extends in length one thousand and twenty miles, if we measure
from the foot of the Alps at Pr&aelig;toria Augusta, through
the city of Rome and Capua to the town of Rhegium, which
is situated on the shoulder of the Peninsula, just at the bend
of the neck as it were. Its breadth is variable, being four
hundred and ten miles between the two seas of the far north.
At about the middle, and in the vicinity of the city of Rome,
from the spot where the river Aternus flows into the Adriatic
sea, to the mouth of the Tiber, the distance is one hundred
and thirty-six miles, and a little less from Castrum-novum on
the Adriatic sea to Alsium on the Tuscan; but in no place
does it exceed two hundred miles in breadth.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="large">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />THE HYPERBOREANS.</h2>
<p>In the far North, beyond the Riph&aelig;an<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> mountains, is the
region known by the name of Pterophoros,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> because of the
perpetual fall of snow there, the flakes of which resemble
feathers; a part of the world which has been condemned by
the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited
for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum
of the chilling blasts of the northern winds.</p>
<p>Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of the
northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a
happy race, known as the Hyperborei,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> a race that lives to
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
an extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many
marvellous stories.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> At this spot are supposed to be the
hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits
of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six
months together, given by the sun in one continuous day.
To these people there is but one rising of the sun for the
year, and that at the summer solstice,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> and but one setting,
at the winter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of
the sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt
from every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are the
woods and groves, the gods receive their worship singly and
in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are
things utterly unknown. Death comes upon them only when
satiated with life; after a career of feasting, in an old age
sated with every luxury, they leap from a certain rock there
into the sea; and this they deem the most desirable mode of
ending existence. Some writers have placed these people,
not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia.
Others again have placed them midway between the two suns,
at the spot where it sets to the Antipodes and rises to us; a
thing however that cannot possibly be, in consequence of the
vast tract of sea which there intervenes. Those writers who
place them nowhere but under a day which lasts for six
months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
reap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during
the night conceal themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty
to entertain any doubts as to the existence of this race;
so many authors are there who assert that they were in the
habit of sending their first-fruits to Delos to present them to
Apollo, whom they especially worship. Virgins used to
carry them, who for many years were held in high veneration,
and received the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay
on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations
of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination
to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the
people who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to
convey them on to their neighbors, and so from one to the
other, till they should have arrived at Delos. However, this
custom, even, in time fell into disuse.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="large">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />BRITANNIA.</h2>
<p>Opposite to the west coast of Europe is the island called
Britannia, so celebrated in the records of Greece<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> and of our
own country. It is situate to the north-west, and, with a
large tract of intervening sea, lies opposite to Germany, Gaul,
and Spain, by far the greater part of Europe. Its former
name was Albion.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> This island is distant from the coast of
the nation of the Morini,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> at the spot where the passage
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas and Isidorus say
that its circumference is 4875 miles. It is barely thirty years
since any extensive knowledge of it was gained by the successes
of the Roman arms, and even as yet they have not
penetrated beyond the vicinity of the Caledonian<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> forest.
Agrippa believes its length to be 800 miles, and its breadth
300; he also thinks that the breadth of Hibernia is the same,
but that its length is less by 200 miles. This last island is situated
beyond Britannia, the passage across being the shortest
from the territory of the Silures,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> a distance of thirty miles.
Of the remaining islands none is said to have a greater circumference
than one hundred and twenty-five miles. Among
these there are the Orcades,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> forty in number, and situated
within a short distance of each other, the seven islands
called Acmod&aelig;.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> The most remote of all that we find mentioned
is Thule,<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> in which, there is no night at the summer
solstice, when the sun is passing through the sign of Cancer,
while on the other hand at the winter solstice there is no day.
Some writers are of opinion that this state of things lasts for
six whole months together.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="large">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />MOUNT ATLAS.</h2>
<p>Through the nation of the Autololes lies the road to
Mount Atlas, the most fabulous locality even in Africa.</p>
<p>From the midst of the sands, according to the story, this
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
mountain<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> raises its head to the heavens; rugged and craggy
on the side which looks toward the shores of the ocean to
which it has given its name, while on that which faces the
interior of Africa it is shaded by dense groves of trees, and
refreshed by flowing streams; fruits of all kinds springing up
there spontaneously to such an extent, as more than to satiate
every possible desire. Throughout the daytime, no inhabitant
is to be seen; all is silent, like that dreadful stillness
which reigns in the desert. A religious horror steals imperceptibly
over the feelings of those who approach, and they
feel themselves smitten with awe at the stupendous aspect of
its summit, which reaches beyond the clouds, and well nigh
approaches the very orb of the moon. At night, they say, it
gleams with fires innumerable lighted up; it is then the scene
of the gambols of the Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the
notes of the flute and the pipe, and the clash of drums and
cymbals. All this is what authors of high character have
stated, in addition to the labors which Hercules and Perseus
there experienced. The space which intervenes before you
arrive at this mountain is immense, and the country quite
unknown.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />THE ISLAND OF TAPROBANA.</h2>
<p>Taprobana,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> under the name of the &ldquo;land of the Antipodes,&rdquo;
was long looked upon as another world: the age and
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the arms of Alexander the Great were the first to give satisfactory
proof that it was an island. Onesicritus, the commander
of his fleet, has informed us that the elephants of
this island are larger, and better adapted for warfare than
those of India; and from Megasthenes we learn that it is
divided by a river, and that their country is more productive
of gold and pearls of great size than even India. Eratosthenes
has also given the dimensions of this island, as being
seven thousand stadia in length, and five thousand in
breadth: he states also that there are no cities, but villages
to the number of seven hundred. It begins at the Eastern
sea, and lies extended opposite to India, east and west. In
former times when the navigation was confined to vessels
constructed of papyrus with the tackle peculiar to the Nile,
this island was supposed to be twenty days&rsquo; sail from the
country of the Prasii,<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> but the distance has been estimated at
no more than seven days&rsquo; sail,<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> reckoned at the speed which
can be attained by vessels of our construction. The sea that
lies between the island and the mainland is full of shallows,
not more than six paces in depth; but in certain channels
it is of such extraordinary depth, that no anchor has ever
found a bottom. For this reason it is that the vessels are
constructed with prows at either end; so that there may be
no necessity for tacking while navigating these extremely narrow
channels. The tonnage of these vessels is three thousand
amphor&aelig;. In traversing their seas, the people of Taprobana
take no observations of the stars, and indeed the
Great Bear is not visible to them; but they carry birds out
to sea, which they let go from time to time, and so follow
their course as they make for the land. They devote only
four months in the year to the pursuits of navigation, and are
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
particularly careful not to trust themselves on the sea during
the next hundred days after our summer solstice, for in those
seas it is at that time the middle of winter.</p>
<p>So much we learn from the ancient writers; it has fallen to
our lot, however, to obtain a still more accurate knowledge of
these people; for, during the reign of the Emperor Claudius,
an embassy came from even this distant island to Rome.
The circumstances under which this took place were as follows:
Annius Plocamus had farmed from the treasury the
revenues arising from the Red Sea. A certain freedman of
his, while sailing around Arabia, was carried away by a gale
from the north beyond the coast of Carmania. In the course
of fifteen days he had drifted to Hippuros, a port of Taprobana,
where he was most kindly and most hospitably received
by the king; and having, after a study of six months, become
well acquainted with the language, was enabled to answer all
his enquiries relative to the Romans and their emperor. But
of all that he heard, the king was more particularly struck
with surprise at our rigid notions of justice, on ascertaining
that among the coins found on the captive, the denarii were
all of equal weight, although the different figures on them
plainly showed that they had been struck in the reigns of several
emperors. By this circumstance especially, the king was
prompted to form an alliance with the Romans, and accordingly
sent to Rome an embassy, consisting of four persons,
the chief of whom was Rachias.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>From these persons we learned that in Taprobana there
are five hundred towns, and that there is a harbor that lies
facing the south, and adjoining the city of Pal&aelig;simundus, the
most famous city in the isle, the king&rsquo;s place of residence, and
containing a population of two hundred thousand. They
also informed us that in the interior there is a lake called
Megisba, three hundred and seventy-five miles in circumference,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
and containing islands which are fertile, though for pasturage
only. In this lake they informed us two rivers take
their rise, one of which, called Pal&aelig;simundus, flows into the
harbor near the city of that name, by three channels, the narrowest
of which is five stadia in width, the largest fifteen:
while the other, Cydara by name, takes a direction northward,
towards the Indian coast. We learned also that the
nearest point of the Indian coast is a promontory known as
Coliacum,<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> distant from the island four days&rsquo; sail, and that
midway between them lies the island of the Sun. They
stated also that those seas are of a deep green tint; besides
which, there are numerous trees growing at the bottom, so
much so, that the rudders of the vessels frequently break off
portions of their foliage.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> They were as much astonished at
the constellations which are visible to us, the Great Bear and
the Pleiades,<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> as though they had now beheld a new expanse
of the heavens; and they declared that in their country the
moon can only be seen above the horizon<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> from the eighth
to its sixteenth day. They also stated that Canopus, a large
bright star, gives light to them by night. But what surprised
them more than anything else, was that the shadow of their
bodies was thrown towards our hemisphere.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> They also informed
us that the side of their island which lies opposite to
India is ten thousand stadia in length, and runs in a southeasterly
direction&mdash;that beyond the Emodian Mountains they
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
look towards<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> the Ser&aelig;, whose acquaintance they had also
made in the pursuits of commerce; that the father of Rachias
had frequently visited their country, and that the Ser&aelig; always
came to meet them on their arrival. These people, they
said, exceeded the ordinary human height, had flaxen hair,
and blue eyes, and made an uncouth sort of noise by way of
talking, having no language of their own for the purpose of
communicating their thoughts. The rest of their information
relative to the Ser&aelig; was of a similar nature to that communicated
by our merchants. It was to the effect that the merchandise
on sale was left by them upon the opposite bank of
a river on their coast, and it was then removed by the natives,
if they thought proper to deal on terms of exchange. On no
grounds ought luxury with greater reason to be detested by
us, than if we only transport our thoughts to these scenes,
and then reflect, what are its demands, to what distant spots
it sends in order to satisfy them, and for how mean and how
unworthy an end!</p>
<p>But yet Taprobana even, isolated as it is by nature from
the rest of the world, is not exempt from our vices. Gold
and silver are held in esteem even there. They have a marble
which resembles tortoise-shell in appearance; this, as well
as their pearls and precious stones, is highly valued; all our
luxuries in fact, those even of the most exquisite nature, are
there carried to the very highest pitch. They asserted that
their wealth was much greater than ours, but admitted that
we knew better than they how to obtain real enjoyment from
opulence.</p>
<p>In this island no slavery exists; they do not prolong their
sleep to day-break, nor do they sleep during any part of the
day; their buildings are only of a moderate height from the
ground; the price of corn is always the same; they have no
courts of law and no litigation. Hercules is the deity whom
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
they worship; and their king is chosen by the people, an
aged man always, distinguished for his mild and clement disposition,
and without children. If after he has been elected
king, he happens to become the father of children, his abdication
is the consequence; this is done that there may be no
danger of the sovereign power becoming hereditary. Thirty
advisers are provided for him by the people, and it is only by
the advice of the majority of them that any man is condemned
to capital punishment. Even then, the person so condemned
has a right of appealing to the people, in which case a jury
consisting of seventy persons is appointed. Should these acquit
the accused, the thirty counsellors are no longer held in
any estimation, but are visited with the greatest disgrace.
The king wears the costume of Father Liber,<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> while the rest
of the people dress like the natives of Arabia. If the king
is found guilty of any offence, he is condemned to death; but
no one slays him; all turn their backs upon him, and refuse
to hold any communication or even discourse with him.
Their festivals are celebrated with the chase, the most valued
sports being the pursuit of the tiger and the elephant. The
lands are carefully tilled; the vine is not cultivated there, but
of other fruits there is great abundance. They take great delight
in fishing, and especially in catching turtles; beneath the
shells of which whole families find an abode, of such vast size
are they to be found. These people look upon a hundred
years as a comparatively short life. So much have we learned
respecting Taprobana.</p>

<br />MAN, HIS BIRTH AND HIS ORGANIZATION.</h2>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />MAN.</h2>
<p>Remarkable as is the present state of the world, and of the
countries, nations, seas, islands, and cities which it contains,
the nature of the animated beings which exist upon it, is
hardly in any degree less worthy of our contemplation than
its other features; if, indeed, the human mind is able to embrace
the whole of so diversified a subject. Our first attention
is justly due to Man, for whose sake all other things
appear to have been produced by Nature; though, on the
other hand, with so great and so severe penalties for the enjoyment
of her bounteous gifts, that it is far from easy to
determine, whether she has proved to him a kind parent, or a
merciless step-mother.</p>
<p>In the first place, she obliges him alone, of all animated
beings, to clothe himself with the spoils of the others; while,
to all the rest, she has given various kinds of coverings, such
as shells, crusts, spines, hides, fur, bristles, hair, down,
feathers, scales, and fleeces. The very trunks of the trees
even, she has protected against the effects of heat and cold by
a bark, which is, in some cases, twofold. Man alone, at the
very moment of his birth cast naked upon the naked earth, she
abandons to cries, to lamentations, and, a thing that is the case
with no other animal whatever, to tears: this, too, from the
very moment that he enters upon existence. But as for
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
laughter, why, by Hercules!&mdash;to laugh, if but for an instant
only, has never been granted to man before the fortieth day
from his birth, and even then it is looked upon as a miracle
of precocity. Introduced thus to the light, man has fetters
and swathings instantly put upon all his limbs,<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> a thing that
falls to the lot of none of the brutes even that are born among
us. Born to such singular good fortune, there on his back
lies the animal which is destined to command all the others,
fast bound hand and foot, and weeping aloud! such being
the penalty which he has to pay on beginning life, and that
for the sole fault of having been born. Alas! for the folly
of those who can think after such a beginning as this, that
they have been born for the display of vanity!</p>
<p>The earliest presage of future strength, the earliest bounty
of time, confers upon him naught but the resemblance to a
quadruped.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> How soon does man gain the power of walking?
How soon does he gain the faculty of speech? How soon is
his mouth fitted for mastication? How long are the pulsations
of the crown of his head to proclaim him the weakest of
all animated beings? And then, the diseases to which he is
subject, the numerous remedies which he is obliged to devise
against his maladies, and those thwarted every now and then
by new forms and features of disease. While other animals
have an instinctive knowledge of their natural powers; some,
of their swiftness of pace, some of their rapidity of flight, and
some again of their power of swimming; man is the only one
that knows nothing, that can learn nothing without being
taught; he can neither speak, nor walk, nor eat&mdash;in short,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
he can do nothing, at the prompting of nature only, but weep.
For this it is, that many have been of opinion, that it were
better not to have been born, or if born, to have been annihilated
at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>To man alone, of all animated beings, has it been given, to
grieve, to him alone to be guilty of luxury and excess; and
that in modes innumerable. Man is the only being that is a
prey to ambition, to avarice, to an immoderate desire of life,
to superstition,&mdash;he is the only one that troubles himself
about his burial, and even what is to become of him after
death. By none is life held on a tenure more frail; none are
more influenced by unbridled desires for all things; none are
sensible of fears more bewildering; none are actuated by rage
more frantic and violent. Other animals, in fine, live at peace
with those of their own kind; we only see them unite to
make a stand against those of a different species. The fierceness
of the lion is not expended in fighting with its own kind;
the sting of the serpent is not aimed at the serpent;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> and
the monsters of the sea even, and the fishes, vent their rage
only on those of a different species. But with man,&mdash;by
Hercules! most of <i>his</i> misfortunes are occasioned by man.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>What is there that does not appear marvellous, when it
comes to our knowledge for the first time? How many
things, too, are looked upon as quite impossible, until they
have been actually effected? But it is the fact, that every
moment of our existence we are distrusting the power and
the majesty of Nature, if the mind, instead of grasping her in
her entirety, considers her only in detail. Not to speak of
peacocks, the spotted skins of tigers and panthers, and the
rich colors of so many animals, a trifling thing apparently to
speak of, but of inestimable importance, when we give it due
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
consideration, is the existence of so many languages among
the various nations, so many modes of speech, so great a variety
of expressions; that to another, a man who is of a different
country, is almost the same as no man at all. And then,
too, the human features and countenance, although composed
of but some ten parts or a little more, are so fashioned, that
among so many thousands of men, there are no two in existence
who cannot be distinguished from one another, a result
which no art could possibly have produced, when confined to so
limited a number of combinations. In most points, however,
of this nature, I shall not be content to pledge my own credit
only, but shall confirm it in preference by referring to my
authorities, which shall be given on all subjects of a nature to
inspire doubt. My readers, however, must make no objection
to following the Greeks, who have proved themselves the most
careful observers, as well as of the longest standing.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE WONDERFUL FORMS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS.</h2>
<p>There are certain tribes of the Scythians, and, indeed,
many other nations, which feed upon human flesh. This fact
itself might, perhaps, appear incredible, did we not recollect,
that in the very centre of the earth, in Italy and Sicily, nations
formerly existed with these monstrous propensities, the
Cyclopes, and the L&aelig;strygones, for example; and that, very
recently, on the other side of the Alps, it was the custom to
offer human sacrifices, after the manner of those nations; and
the difference is but small between sacrificing human beings
and eating them.</p>
<p>In the vicinity also of those who dwell in the northern regions,
and not far from the spot from which the north wind
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
arises, and the place which is called its cave, and is known by
the name of Geskleithron, the Arimaspi are said to exist, a
nation remarkable for having but one eye, and that placed in
the middle of the forehead. This race is said to carry on a
perpetual warfare with the Griffins, a kind of monster, with
wings, as they are commonly<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> represented, for the gold
which they dig out of the mines, and which these wild beasts
retain and keep watch over with a singular degree of cupidity,
while the Arimaspi are equally desirous to get possession of
it. Many authors have corroborated this fact, among the
most illustrious of whom are Herodotus and Aristeas of
Proconnesus.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></p>
<p>Beyond the other Scythian Anthropophagi, there is a country
called Abarimon, situated in a certain great valley of
Mount Imaus, the inhabitants of which are a savage race,
whose feet are turned backwards, relatively to their legs: they
possess wonderful velocity, and wander about indiscriminately
with the wild beasts. We learn from Beeton, whose duty it
was to take the measurements of the routes of Alexander the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Great, that this people cannot breathe in any climate except
their own, for which reason it is impossible to take them before
any of the neighboring kings; nor could any of them be
brought before Alexander himself.</p>
<p>The Anthropophagi, whom we have previously mentioned
as dwelling ten days&rsquo; journey beyond the Borysthenes, according
to the account of Isigonus of Nic&aelig;a, were in the habit of
drinking out of human skulls,<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> and placing the scalps, with
the hair attached, upon their breasts, like so many napkins.
The same author relates, that there is, in Albania, a certain
race of men (the Albinoes), whose eyes are of a sea-green color,
and who have white hair from their earliest childhood, and
that these people see better in the night than in the day. He
states also that the Sauromatae, who dwell ten days&rsquo; journey
beyond the Borysthenes, take food only every other day. Isigonus
says there are among the Triballi and the Illyrii, some
persons who have the power of fascination with the eyes, and
can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze for any length
of time, especially if their look denotes anger.</p>
<p>A still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these
persons have two pupils in each eye. Apollonides says, that
there are certain females of this description in Scythia, who
are known as Bythi&aelig;, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of
the Thibii in Pontus, and many other persons as well, have a
double pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a
horse.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons
will not sink in water,<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> even though weighed down by their
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
garments. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the
remark, that the glances of all women who have a double
pupil is noxious.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>Not far from the city of Rome, in the territory of the Falisci,
a few families are found, who are known by the name of
Hirpi. These people perform a yearly sacrifice to Apollo, on
Mount Soracte, on which occasion they walk over a burning
pile of wood, without even being scorched. On this account,
by virtue of a decree
of the senate, they are
always exempted from
military service, and
from all other public
duties.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/i_p043.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="660" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">THE INDIAN ELEPHANT.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Some individuals,
again, are born with
certain parts of the
body endowed with
properties of a marvellous
nature. Such was
the case with King Pyrrhus,
the great toe of
whose right foot cured
diseases of the spleen,
merely by touching the
patient.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> We are also informed, that this toe could not be reduced
to ashes together with the other portions of his body;
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
upon which it was placed in a coffer, and preserved in a
temple.</p>
<p>India, and the region of &AElig;thiopia more especially, abounds
in wonders. In India the largest of animals are produced;
their dogs, for example, are much bigger than those of any
other country. The trees, too, are said to be of such vast
height, that it is impossible to send an arrow over them.
This is the result of the singular fertility of the soil, the equable
temperature of the atmosphere, and the abundance of
water; which, if we are to believe what is said, are such, that
a single fig-tree<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> is capable of affording shelter to a whole
troop of horse. The reeds here are also of such enormous
length, that each portion of them, between the joints, forms a
tube, of which a boat is made that is capable of holding three
men.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> It is a well-known fact, that many of the people here
are more than five cubits in height.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> These people never
expectorate, are subject to no pains, either in the head, the
teeth, or the eyes, and rarely in any other parts of the body;
so well is the heat of the sun calculated to strengthen the
constitution. Their philosophers, who are called Gymnosophists,
remain in one posture, with their eyes immovably
fixed upon the sun, from its rising to its setting, and, during
the whole of the day, they are accustomed to stand in the
burning sands on one foot, first one and then the other. According
to the account of Megasthenes, dwelling upon a
mountain called Nulo, there is a race of men who have their
feet turned backwards, with eight toes on each foot.</p>
<p>On many of the mountains again, there is a tribe of men
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
who have the heads of dogs,<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> and clothe themselves with the
skins of wild beasts. Instead of speaking, they bark; and,
furnished with claws, they live by hunting and catching birds.
According to the story, as given by Ctesias, the number of
these people is more than a hundred and twenty thousand.
He speaks also of another race of men, who are known as
Monocoli, who have only one leg, but are able to leap with
surprising agility. The same people are also called Sciapod&aelig;,
because they are in the habit of lying on their backs,
during the time of the extreme heat, and protect themselves
from the sun by the shade of their feet. These people, he
says, dwell not very far from the Troglodyt&aelig;; to the west of
whom again there is a tribe who are without necks, and have
eyes in their shoulders.</p>
<p>Among the mountainous districts of the eastern parts of
India, in what is called the country of the Catharcludi, we
find the Satyr,<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> an animal of extraordinary swiftness. These
go sometimes on four feet, and sometimes walk erect; they
have also the features of a human being. On account of
their swiftness, these creatures are never to be caught, except
when they are either aged or sickly. Tauron gives the name
of Choromand&aelig; to a nation which dwell in the woods and
have no proper voice. These people screech in a frightful
manner; their bodies are covered with hair, their eyes are of
a sea-green color, and their teeth like those of the dog.
Eudoxus tells us, that in the southern parts of India, the
men have feet a cubit in length; while those of the women
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
are so remarkably small, that they are called Struthopodes
or sparrow-footed.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
<p>Megasthenes places among the Nomades of India, a people
who are called Scyrit&aelig;. These have merely holes in
their faces instead of nostrils, and flexible feet, like the body
of the serpent. At the very extremity of India, on the eastern
side, near the source of the river Ganges, there is the
nation of the Astomi, a people who have no mouths; their
bodies are rough and hairy, and they cover themselves with a
down<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> plucked from the leaves of trees. These people subsist
only by breathing and by the odors which they inhale
through the nostrils. They support themselves upon neither
meat nor drink; when they go upon a long journey they only
carry with them various odoriferous roots and flowers, and
wild apples, that they may not be without something to smell
at. But an odor, which is a little more powerful than usual,
easily destroys them.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>Beyond these people, and at the very extremity of the
mountains, the Trispithami and the Pygmies are said to exist;
two races which are but three spans in height, that is to
say, twenty-seven inches only. They enjoy a salubrious
atmosphere, and a perpetual spring, being sheltered by the
mountains from the northern blasts; it is these people that
Homer<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> has mentioned as being warred upon by cranes.
It is said, that they are in the habit of going down every
spring to the sea-shore, in a large body, seated on the backs
of rams and goats, and armed with arrows, and there destroy
the eggs and the young of those birds; that this expedition
occupies them for the space of three months, and that otherwise
it would be impossible for them to withstand the increasing
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
multitudes of the cranes. Their cabins, it is said, are
built of mud, mixed with feathers and egg-shells. Aristotle
says, that they dwell in caves; but, in all other respects,
he gives the same details as other writers.</p>
<p>Isigonus informs us, that the Cyrni, a people of India, live
to their four hundredth year; and he is of opinion that the
same is the case also with the &AElig;thiopian Macrobii, the Ser&aelig;,
and the inhabitants of Mount Athos. In the case of these
last, it is supposed to be owing to the flesh of vipers,<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> which
they use as food; in consequence of which, they are free also
from all noxious animals, both in their hair and their garments.</p>
<p>According to Onesicritus, in those parts of India where
there is no shadow, the bodies of men attain a height of five
cubits and two palms, and their life is prolonged to one hundred
and thirty years; they die without any symptoms of old
age, and just as if they were in the middle period of life.
Ctesias mentions a tribe known by the name of Pandore,
whose locality is in the valleys, and who live to their two
hundredth year; their hair is white in youth, and becomes
black in old age. On the other hand, there are some people
joining up to the country of the Macrobii, who never live
beyond their fortieth year, and there is never more than one
child in a family. This circumstance is also mentioned by
Agatharchides, who states, in addition, that they live on
locusts, and are very swift of foot. Clitarchus and Megasthenes
give these people the name of Mandi, and enumerate
as many as three hundred villages which belong to them.
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Their women marry in the seventh year of their age, and
become old at forty.</p>
<p>Artemidorus states that in the island of Taprobana, life is
prolonged to an extreme length, while, at the same time, the
body is exempt from weakness. Among the Caling&aelig;, a
nation also of India, the women marry at five years of age,
and do not live beyond their eighth year. In other places
again, there are men born with long hairy tails, and of
remarkable swiftness of foot; while there are others that
have ears so large as to cover the whole body.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>There is a tribe of &AElig;thiopian Nomades dwelling on the
banks of the river Astragus, towards the north, and about
twenty days&rsquo; journey from the ocean. These people are
called Menismini; they live on the milk of the animal which
we call cynocephalus,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> and rear large flocks of these creatures.
In the deserts of Africa, men are frequently seen to all
appearance, and then vanish in an instant.</p>
<p>Nature, in her ingenuity, has created all these marvels in
the human race, with others of a similar nature, as so many
amusements to herself, though they appear miraculous to us.
But who is there that can enumerate all the things that she
brings to pass each day, I may almost say each hour? As a
striking evidence of her power, let it be sufficient for me to
have cited whole nations in the list of her prodigies.</p>
<p>Let us now proceed to mention some other particulars connected
with Man, the truth of which is universally admitted.</p>
<p>It is a subject for pity, and even for a feeling of shame,
when one reflects that the origin and life of the most vain of
all animated beings is so frail: Thou man, who placest thy
confidence in the strength of thy body, thou, who dost
embrace the gifts of Fortune, and look upon thyself, not only
as her fosterling, but even as her own born child, thou, whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
mind is ever thirsting for blood, thou who, puffed up with
some success or other, dost think thyself a god&mdash;by how trifling
a thing might thy life have been cut short! Even this
very day, something still less even may have the same effect,
the puncture, for instance, of the tiny sting of the serpent; or
even, as befell the poet Anacreon, the swallowing of the stone
of a raisin, or of a single hair in a draught of milk, by which
the pr&aelig;tor and senator, Fabius, was choked, and so met
his death. He only, in fact, will be able to form a just estimate
of the value of life, who will always bear in mind the
extreme frailty of its tenure.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />INSTANCES OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH.</h2>
<p>Varro, speaking of persons remarkable for their strength,
gives us an account of Tributanus, a celebrated gladiator, and
skilled in the use of the Samnite arms;<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> he was a man of
meagre person, but possessed of extraordinary strength.
Varro makes mention of his son also, who served in the army
of Pompey. He says, that in all parts of his body, even in
the arms and hands, there was a network of sinews, extending
across and across. The latter of these men, having been
challenged by an enemy, vanquished him with a single finger
of the right hand, and that unarmed, and then seized and
dragged him to the camp. Vinnius Valens, who served as a
centurion in the pr&aelig;torian guard of Augustus, was in the
habit of holding up wagons laden with casks, until they were
emptied; and of stopping a carriage with one hand, and holding
it back, against all the efforts of the horses to drag it
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
forward. He performed other wonderful feats also, an
account of which may still be seen inscribed on his monument.
Varro, also, gives the following statement: &ldquo;Fusius,
who used to be called the &lsquo;bumpkin Hercules,&rsquo; was in the
habit of carrying his own mule; while Salvius was able to
mount a ladder, with a weight of two hundred pounds
attached to his feet, the same to his hands, and two hundred
pounds on each shoulder.&rdquo; I myself once saw,&mdash;a most marvellous
display of strength,&mdash;a man of the name of Athanatus
walk across the stage, wearing a leaden breast-plate of five
hundred pounds weight, while shod with buskins of the same
weight. When Milo, the wrestler, had once taken his stand,
there was not a person who could move him from his position;
and when he grasped an apple in his hand, no one
could so much as open one of his fingers.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE AGILITY AND ACUTENESS OF SIGHT.</h2>
<p>It was considered a very great thing for Philippides to run
one thousand one hundred and sixty stadia, the distance
between Athens and Laced&aelig;mon, in two days, until Amystis,
the Laced&aelig;monian courier, and Philonides, the courier of
Alexander the Great, ran from Sicyon to Elis in one day, a
distance of thirteen hundred and five stadia.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> In our own
times, too, we are fully aware that there are men in the Circus,
who are able to keep on running for a distance of one
hundred and sixty miles; and that lately, in the consulship of
Fonteius and Vipstanus, there was a child eight years of age,
who, between morning and evening, ran a distance of seventy-five
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
miles. We become all the more sensible of these wonderful
instances of swiftness, upon reflecting that Tiberius
Nero, when he made all possible haste to reach his brother
Drusus, who was then sick in Germany, reached him in three
stages, travelling day and night on the road; the distance of
each stage was two hundred miles.</p>
<p>Instances of acuteness of sight are to be found stated,
which, indeed, exceed all belief. Cicero informs us, that the
Iliad<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> of Homer was written on a piece of parchment so
small as to be enclosed in a nut-shell. He makes mention
also of a man who could distinguish objects at a distance of
one hundred and twenty-five miles. Marcus Varro says, that
the name of this man was Strabo; and that, during the Punic
war, from Lilyb&aelig;um, the promontory of Sicily, he was in the
habit of seeing the fleet come out of the harbor of Carthage,
at a distance of over fifty miles, and could even count the
number of the vessels. Callicrates used to carve ants and
other small animals in ivory, so minute in size, that other
persons were unable to distinguish their individual parts.
Myrmecides also was famous in the same line;<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> this man
made, of similar material, a chariot drawn by four horses,
which a fly could cover with its wings; as well as a ship which
might be covered by the wings of a tiny bee.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />VIGOR OF MIND, AND COURAGE.</h2>
<p>The most remarkable instance, I think, of vigor of mind in
any man ever born, was that of C&aelig;sar, the Dictator. I am
not at present alluding to his valor and courage, nor yet his
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
exalted genius, which was capable of embracing everything
under the face of heaven, but I am speaking of that innate
vigor of mind, which was so peculiar to him, and that promptness
which seemed to act like a flash of lightning. We find
it stated that he was able to write or read, and, at the same
time, to dictate and listen. He could dictate to his secretaries
four letters at once, and those on the most important
business; and, indeed, if he was busy about nothing else, as
many as seven. He fought as many as fifty pitched battles,
being the only commander who exceeded M. Marcellus in
this respect, he having fought only thirty-nine. In addition,
too, to the victories gained by him in the civil wars, one million
one hundred and ninety-two thousand men were slain by
him in his battles. For my own part, however, I am not
going to set down as a subject for high renown what was
really an outrage committed upon mankind, even though he
may have been acting under the strong influence of necessity;
and, indeed, he himself confesses as much, in his omission to
state the number of persons who perished by the sword in
the civil wars.</p>
<p>With much more justice we may award credit to Pompey
the Great for having taken from the pirates no less than
eight hundred and forty-six vessels: though at the same
time, over and above the great qualities previously mentioned,
we must with equal justice give C&aelig;sar the peculiar
credit of a remarkable degree of clemency, a quality, in the
exercise of which, even to repentance, he excelled all other
individuals whatsoever. The same person has left us one
instance of magnanimity, to which there is nothing that can
be at all compared. While one, who was an admirer of luxury,
might perhaps on this occasion have enumerated the
spectacles which he exhibited, the treasures which he lavished
away, and the magnificence of his public works, I maintain
that it was the great proof, and an incomparable one, of an
elevated mind, for him to have burnt with the most scrupulous
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
carefulness the papers of Pompey, which were taken in
his desk at the battle of Pharsalia, and those of Scipio, taken
at Thapsus, without so much as reading them.</p>
<p>But now, as it belongs fully as much to the glorious renown
of the Roman Empire, as to the victorious career of a single
individual, I shall proceed on this occasion to make mention
of all the triumphs and titles of Pompey: the splendor of his
exploits having equalled not only that of those of Alexander
the Great, but even of Hercules, and perhaps of Father
Liber<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> even. After having recovered Sicily, where he first
commenced his career as a partisan of Sylla, but in behalf of
the republic, after having conquered the whole of Africa, and
reduced it to subjection, and after having received for his
share of the spoil the title of &ldquo;Great,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> he was decreed the
honors of a triumph; and he, though only of equestrian rank,
a thing that had never occurred before, re-entered the city in
the triumphal chariot; immediately after which, he hastened
to the west, where he left it inscribed on the trophy which he
raised upon the Pyrenees, that he had, by his victories, reduced
to subjection eight hundred and seventy-six cities, from
the Alps to the borders of Farther Spain. After having put
an end to the civil war, which indeed was the primary cause
of all the foreign ones, he, though still of only equestrian
rank, again entered Rome in the triumphal chariot, having
thus often proved himself a general before having been a
common soldier. After this, he was despatched to the shores
of all the various seas, and then to the East, whence he
brought back to his country many titles of honor, resembling
therein those who conquer at the sacred games&mdash;for, be it
remembered, it is not they that are crowned, but their respective
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
countries. Upon the shrine in the temple of Minerva,
which he consecrated from the spoils that he had gained, are
these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Cneius Pompeius Magnus, Imperator, having
brought to an end a war of thirty years&rsquo; duration, and
having defeated, routed, put to the sword, or received the
submission of, twelve millions two hundred and seventy-eight
thousand men, having sunk or captured eight hundred and
forty-six vessels, having received as allies one thousand five
hundred and thirty-eight cities and fortresses, and having conquered
all the country from the M&aelig;otis to the Red Sea, dedicates
this shrine as a votive offering due to Minerva.&rdquo; Such,
in few words, is the sum of his exploits in the East. The
following are the introductory words descriptive of the triumph
which he celebrated on the 29th and 30th of September,
in the consulship of M. Piso and M. Messala (<span class="small">B.C.</span> 61):
&ldquo;After having delivered the sea-coast from the pirates, and
restored the seas to the people of Rome, he enjoyed a triumph
over Asia, Pontus, Armenia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia,
Cilicia, Syria, the Scythians, Jud&aelig;a, the Albanians, Iberia, the
island of Crete, the Basterni, and, in addition to all these, the
kings Mithridates and Tigranes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most glorious, however, of all glories, resulting from
these exploits, was, as he himself says, in the speech which
he made in public relative to his previous career, that Asia
Minor, which he received as the boundary of the empire, he
left as its centre. If any one should wish, on the other hand,
in a similar manner, to pass in review the exploits of C&aelig;sar,
who has shown himself greater still than Pompey, why then,
he must enumerate all the countries in the world, a task, I
may say, without an end!</p>
<p>A minute inquiry by whom the greatest valor has ever
been exhibited, would lead to an endless discussion, especially
if all the fables of the poets are to be taken for granted.
Lucius Siccius Dentatus, who was tribune of the people in
the consulship of Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aterius (<span class="small">B.C.</span>
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
454), not long after the expulsion of the kings, has very
numerous testimonies in his favor. This hero fought one
hundred and twenty battles, was eight times victorious in
single combat, and was graced with forty-five wounds in the
front of the body, without one on the back. The same man
also carried off thirty-four spoils, was eighteen times presented
with the victor&rsquo;s spear,<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> and received twenty-five pendants,
eighty-three torcs, or golden ornaments, one hundred
and sixty bracelets, twenty-six crowns, a fisc or chest of
money, ten prisoners, and twenty oxen. He followed in the
triumphal processions of nine generals, who mainly owed
their victories to his exertions; besides all which, a thing that
I look upon as the most important of all his services, he denounced
to the people Titus Romilius, one of the generals of
the army, at the end of his consulship, and had him convicted
of having made an improper use of his authority.</p>
<p>The military honors of Manlius Capitolinus would have
been no less splendid than his, if they had not been all effaced
at the close of his life. Before his seventeenth year, he had
gained two spoils, and was the first of equestrian rank who
received a mural crown; he also gained six civic crowns,
thirty-seven donations, and had twenty-three scars on the
fore-part of his body. He saved the life of P. Servilius, the
master of the horse, receiving wounds on the same occasion
in the shoulders and the thigh. Besides all this, unaided, he
saved the Capitol, when it was attacked by the Gauls, and
through that, the state itself; a thing that would have been
the most glorious act of all, if he had not so saved it, in order
that he might, as its king, become its master. But in all
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
matters of this nature, although valor may effect much, fortune
does still more.</p>
<p>No person living, in my opinion at least, ever excelled
Marcus Sergius, although his great-grandson, Catiline, tarnished
the honors of his name. In his second campaign he
lost his right hand; and in two campaigns he was wounded
three and twenty times&mdash;so severely that he could scarcely
use either his hands or his feet; still, attended by a single
slave, he afterwards served in many campaigns, though but
an invalided soldier. He was twice taken prisoner by Hannibal,
(for it was with no ordinary enemy that he would
engage,) and twice did he escape from his captivity, after
having been kept, without a single day&rsquo;s intermission, in
chains and fetters for twenty months. On four occasions he
fought with his left hand alone, two horses being slain under
him. He had a right hand made of iron, and attached to
the stump, after which he fought a battle, and raised the
siege of Cremona, defended Placentia, and took twelve of the
enemy&rsquo;s camps in Gaul. All this we learn from an oration of
his, which he delivered when, in his pr&aelig;torship, his colleagues
attempted to exclude him from the sacred rites, on the ground
of his infirmities.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> What heaps upon heaps of crowns would
he have piled up, if he had only had other enemies! For, in
matters of this nature, it is of the first importance to consider
in what times the valor of each man has fallen. What
civic crowns did Trebia, what did the Ticinus, what did Lake
Thrasymenus afford? What crown was there to be gained at
Cann&aelig;, where it was deemed the greatest effort of valor to
have escaped from the enemy? Other persons have been
conquerors of men, no doubt, but Sergius conquered even
Fortune herself.</p>

<br />MEN OF REMARKABLE GENIUS AND WISDOM.</h2>
<p>Among so many different pursuits, and so great a variety of
works and objects, who can select the palm of glory for transcendent
genius? Unless perchance we should agree in
opinion that no more brilliant genius ever existed than the
Greek poet Homer, whether we look at the happy subject of
his work, or the excellence of its execution. For this reason
it was that Alexander the Great, when he found among the
spoils of Darius, the King of Persia, a casket for perfumes,
enriched with gold, precious stones, and pearls, covered as he
was with the dust of battle, deemed it beneath a warrior to
make use of unguents, and, when his friends were pointing
out to him its various uses, exclaimed, &ldquo;Nay, but by Hercules!
let the casket be used for preserving the poems of
Homer;&rdquo; that so the most precious work of the human mind
might be placed in the keeping of the richest work of art. It
was the same conqueror, too, who gave directions that the
descendants and house of the poet Pindar should be spared,
at the taking of Thebes. He likewise rebuilt Stagira, the
native city of Aristotle, uniting to the extraordinary brilliancy
of his exploits this speaking testimony of his kindliness of
disposition.</p>
<p>Dionysius the tyrant, who otherwise manifested a natural
propensity for cruelty and pride, sent a vessel crowned with
garlands to meet Plato, that high-priest of wisdom; and on
his disembarkation, received him on the shore, in a chariot
drawn by four white horses. Isocrates was able to sell a
single oration of his for twenty thousand dollars. When
&AElig;schines, the great Athenian orator, had read to the
Rhodians the speech which he had made on the accusation of
Demosthenes he then read the defence made by Demosthenes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
through which he had been driven into exile among
them. When they expressed their admiration of it, he
exclaimed:&mdash;&ldquo;How much more would you have admired it,
if you had heard him deliver it himself;&rdquo; a striking testimony,
indeed, given in adversity, to the merit of an enemy!</p>
<p>The nobles of Rome have given their testimony in favor
of foreigners, even. After Pompey had finished the war
against Mithridates, he went to call at the house of Posidonius,
the famous teacher of philosophy, but forbade the
lictor to knock at the door, as was the usual custom; and he,
to whom both the eastern and the western world had yielded
submission, ordered the fasces to be lowered before the door
of a learned man.</p>
<p>The elder Africanus ordered that the statue of Ennius
should be placed in his tomb, and that the illustrious surname
which he had acquired, I may say, as his share of the spoil on
the conquest of the third part of the world, should be read
over his ashes, along with the name of the poet. The
Emperor Augustus, now deified, forbade the works of Virgil
to be burnt, in opposition to the modest directions to that
effect, which the poet had left in his will: a prohibition which
was a greater compliment paid to his merit, than if he himself
had recommended his works.</p>
<p>Marcus Varro is the only man, who, during his lifetime, saw
his own statue erected. This was placed in the first public
library that was ever built, and which was formed by Asinius
Pollio with the spoils of our enemies. The fact of this distinction
being conferred upon him by one who was in the first
rank, both as an orator and a citizen, and at a time, too, when
there was so great a number of men distinguished for their
genius, was not less honorable to him, in my opinion, than
the naval crown which Pompey bestowed upon him in the
war against the pirates. The instances that follow among
the Romans, if I were to attempt to reckon them, would be
found to be innumerable; for it is the fact that this one
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
nation has furnished a greater number of distinguished men
in every branch than all the countries of the world taken
together.<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
<p>But what atonement could I offer to thee, Marcus Tullius
Cicero, were I to be silent respecting thy name? or on what
ground am I to pronounce thee especially pre&euml;minent? On
what, indeed, that can be more convincing than the most
abundant testimony that was offered in thy favor by the
whole Roman people? Thou speakest, and the tribes surrender
the Agrarian law, or, in other words, their very subsistence;
thou advisest them to do so, and they pardon Roscius,
the author of the law for the regulation of the theatres, and,
without any feelings of resentment, allow a mark to be put
upon themselves by allotting them an inferior seat; thou
entreatest, and the sons of proscribed men blush at having
canvassed for public honors: before thy genius Catiline took
to flight, and it was thou who didst proscribe Marcus Antonius.
Hail, then, to thee, who wast the first of all to receive
the title of Father of thy country, who wast the first of all,
while wearing the toga, to merit a triumph, and who didst
obtain the laurel for oratory. Great father, thou, of eloquence
and of Latin literature! as the Dictator C&aelig;sar, once
thy enemy, wrote in testimony of thee,<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> thou didst require a
laurel superior to every triumph! How far greater and more
glorious to have enlarged so immeasurably the boundaries of
the Roman genius, than those of its sway!</p>

<br />THE NATURE OF TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS.</h2>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />ELEPHANTS; THEIR CAPACITY.</h2>
<p>The elephant is the largest of all the land animals, and in
intelligence approaches the nearest to man. He understands
the language of his country, obeys commands, and remembers
all the duties which he has been taught. He is sensible
alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree
that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty,
prudence, and equity; he has a religious respect also for the
stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> It is
said by some authors, that, at the first appearance of the new
moon, herds of these animals come down from the forests of
Mauritania to a river, the name of which is Amilo; and that
they there purify themselves in solemn form by sprinkling
their bodies with water; after which, having thus saluted the
heavenly body, they return to the woods, carrying before
them the young ones which are fatigued. They are supposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
to have a notion, too, of the differences of religion;
and when about to cross the sea, they cannot be prevailed
upon to go on board the ship until their keeper has promised
upon oath that they shall return home again. They have
been seen, too, when worn out by disease, lying on their
backs and throwing the grass up into the air, as if deputing
the earth to intercede for them with its prayers. As a proof
of their extreme docility, they pay homage to the king, fall
upon their knees, and offer him the crown.</p>
<p>The first harnessed elephants that were seen at Rome,
were in the triumph of Pompey the Great over Africa, when
they drew his chariot; a thing that is said to have been done
long before, at the triumph of Father Liber on the conquest
of India. Procilius<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> says, that those which were used at the
triumph of Pompey were unable to go in harness through the
gate of the city. In the exhibition of gladiators which was
given by Germanicus, the elephants performed a sort of dance
with their uncouth and irregular movements. It was a common
thing to see them throw arrows with such strength, that
the wind was unable to turn them from their course, to imitate
among themselves the combats of the gladiators, and to
frolic through the steps of the Pyrrhic dance. After this,
too, they walked upon the tight-rope,<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> and four of them
would carry a litter in which lay a fifth, who pretended to be
ill. They afterwards took their places at table, reclining
upon couches which were filled with people; and so nicely
did they manage their steps, that they did not so much as
touch any of those who were drinking there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>It is a well-known fact,<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> that one of these animals, who
was slower than usual in learning what was taught him, and
had been frequently chastised with blows, was found conning
over his lesson in the night-time. It is a most surprising
thing also, that the elephant is able not only to walk up the
tight-rope backwards, but to come down it as well, with the
head foremost. Mutianus, who was three times consul, informs
us that one of these animals had been taught to trace
the Greek letters, and that he used to write in that language
the following words: &ldquo;I have myself written these words, and
have dedicated the Celtic spoils.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> Mutianus states also,
that he himself was witness to the fact, that when some elephants
were being landed at Puteoli and were compelled to
leave the ship, being terrified at the length of the platform,
which extended from the vessel to the shore, they walked
backwards, in order to deceive themselves by forming a false
estimate of the distance.</p>
<p>These animals are well aware that the only spoil that we
are anxious to procure of them is the part which forms their
weapon of defence, by Juba called their horns, but by Herodotus,
a much older writer, as well as by general usage and
more appropriately, their teeth. Hence it is that, when their
tusks have fallen off, either by accident or from old age, they
bury them in the earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> These tusks form the only real
ivory, and, even in these, the part which is covered by the
flesh is merely common bone, and of no value whatever;
though, indeed, of late, in consequence of the insufficient supply
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
of Ivory, they have begun to cut the bones as well into thin
plates. Large teeth, in fact, are now rarely found, except in
India, the demands of luxury<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> having exhausted all those in
our part of the world. The youthfulness of the animal is
ascertained by the whiteness of the teeth. These animals
take the greatest care of their teeth; they pay especial attention
to the point of one of them, that it may not be found
blunt when wanted for combat; the other they employ for
various purposes, such as digging up roots and pushing forward
heavy weights. When they are surrounded by the
hunters, they place those in front which have the smallest
teeth, that the enemy may think that the spoil is not worth
the combat; and afterwards, when they are weary of resistance,
they break off their teeth, by dashing them against a
tree, and in this manner pay their ransom.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>It is a wonderful thing, that most animals are aware why
it is that they are sought after, and what it is, that, under all
circumstances, they have to guard against. When an elephant
happens to meet a man in the desert, who is merely
wandering about, the animal, it is said, shows himself both
merciful and kind, and even points out the way. But the
very same animal, if he meets with the traces of a man, before
he meets the man himself, trembles in every limb, for fear of
an ambush, stops short and scents the wind, looks around
him, and snorts aloud with rage; and then, without trampling
upon the object trodden upon, digs it up, and passes it to the
next one, who again passes it to the one that follows, and so
on from one to the other, till it comes to the very last. The
herd then faces about, returns, and ranges itself in order of
battle; so strongly does the odor, in all cases, attach itself to
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the human footstep, even though, as is most frequently the
case, the foot itself is not naked. In the same way, too, the
tigress, which is the dread of the other wild beasts, and which
sees, without alarm, the traces even of the elephant itself, is
said at once, upon seeing the footsteps of man, to carry off
her whelps. How has the animal acquired this knowledge?
And where has it seen him before, of whom it stands in such
dread? Doubt there can be none, that forests such as it
haunts are but little frequented by man! It is not to be
wondered at, if they are astonished at the print of a footstep
before unknown; but how should they know that there is
anything that they ought to dread? And, what is still more,
why should they dread even the very sight of man, seeing
that they are so far superior to him in strength, size, and
swiftness? No doubt, such is the law of Nature, such is the
influence of her power&mdash;the most savage and the very largest
of wild beasts have never seen that which they have reason
to fear, and yet instantly have an instinctive feeling of dread,
when the moment has come for them to fear.</p>
<p>Elephants always move in herds. The oldest takes the
lead, and the next in age brings up the rear. When they
are crossing a river, they first send over the smallest, for fear
lest the weight of the larger ones may increase the depth of
the channel, by working away the bed of the river. We
learn from Antipater, that King Antiochus had two elephants,
which he employed in his wars, and to which he had
given the names of celebrated men; and that they were
aware too of this mark of distinction. Cato, in his Annals,
while he has passed over in silence the names of the generals,
has given that of an elephant called Surus, which fought
with the greatest valor in the Carthaginian army, and had
lost one of its tusks. When Antiochus was sounding the
ford of a river, an elephant named Ajax, which on other occasions
had always led the van, refused to enter the stream;
upon which proclamation was made, that the first rank should
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
belong to the one which should take the lead in passing over.
One called Patroclus hazarded the attempt, and as a reward,
the king presented it with some silver pendants, a kind of
ornament with which these animals are particularly delighted,
and assigned it all the other marks of command. Upon this,
the elephant that had been degraded refused to take its food,
and so preferred death to ignominy. Indeed their sense of
shame is wonderful, and when one of them has been conquered,
it flies at the voice of the conqueror, and presents
him with earth and vervain.</p>
<p>Nor ought we to be surprised that such an animal should
be sensible of affection: for Juba relates, that an elephant
recognized, after the lapse of many years, an old man who
had been its keeper in his youth. They would seem also to
have an instinctive feeling of justice. King Bocchus once
fastened thirty elephants to the stake, with the determination
of wreaking his vengeance on them, by means of thirty
others; but though men kept sallying forth among them to
goad them on, he could not, with all his endeavors, force
them to become the ministers of the cruelty of others.</p>
<p>Elephants were seen in Italy, for the first time, in the war
with King Pyrrhus, in the year of the City 472; they were
called &ldquo;Lucanian oxen,&rdquo; because they were first seen in
Lucania. Seven years after this period, they appeared at
Rome in a triumph. In the year 502 a great number of them
were brought to Rome, which had been taken by the pontiff
Metellus, in his victory gained in Sicily over the Carthaginians.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a>
One hundred and forty-two of them were conveyed
to our shores upon rafts, which were constructed on rows of
hogsheads joined together. Verrius informs us, that they
fought in the Circus, and that they were slain with javelins,
for want of some better method of disposing of them; as the
people neither liked to keep them nor yet to give them to
the kings.</p>

<br />THE COMBATS OF ELEPHANTS.</h2>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">AFRICAN ELEPHANT.</span>&mdash;<i>Loxodonta Africana.</i></p>
</div>
<p>There is a famous combat mentioned of a Roman with an
elephant, when Hannibal compelled our prisoners to fight
against each other. The one who had survived all the others
he placed before an elephant, and promised him his life if he
should slay it; upon which the man advanced alone into the
arena, and, to the great
regret of the Carthaginians,
succeeded in
doing so. Hannibal,
however, thinking that
the news of this victory
might cause a feeling of
contempt for these animals,
sent some horsemen
to kill the man on
his way home. In our
battles with Pyrrhus it
was found, on making
trial, that it was extremely
easy to cut off
the trunks of these animals.
In the second
consulship of Pompey at the dedication of the temple of
Venus Victrix, twenty elephants, or, as some say, seventeen,
fought in the Circus against a number of G&aelig;tulians, who
attacked them with javelins. One of these animals fought in
a most astonishing manner; for, although pierced through
the feet, it dragged itself on its knees towards the troop,
and seizing their bucklers, tossed them aloft into the air:
and as they came to the ground it greatly amused the
spectators, for they whirled round and round in the air,
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
just as if they had been thrown up with a certain degree
of skill, and not by the frantic fury of a wild beast. Another
very wonderful circumstance happened; an elephant was
killed by a single blow. The weapon pierced the animal
below the eye, and entered the vital part of the head. The
elephants attempted, too, by their united efforts, to break
down the enclosure, not without great confusion among the
people who sat next to the iron gratings. It was in consequence
of this circumstance, that C&aelig;sar, the Dictator, when
he was afterwards about to exhibit a similar spectacle, had
the arena surrounded with trenches of water. These were
lately filled up by the Emperor Nero, when he added the
seats for the equestrian order. When, however, the elephants
in the exhibition given by Pompey had lost all hopes
of escaping, they implored the compassion of the multitude
by attitudes which surpass all description, and with a kind of
lamentation bewailed their unhappy fate. So greatly were
the people affected by the scene, that, forgetting the general
altogether, and his munificence displayed in their honor, the
whole assembly rose up in tears, and showered curses on
Pompey, of which he soon afterwards became the victim.
They fought also in the third consulship of the Dictator
C&aelig;sar, twenty of them against five hundred foot soldiers.
On another occasion twenty elephants, carrying towers, and
each defended by sixty men, were opposed to the same number
of foot soldiers as before, and an equal number of horsemen.
Afterwards, under the Emperors Claudius and Nero,
the last exploit that the gladiators performed was fighting
single-handed with elephants.</p>
<p>The elephant is said to display such a merciful disposition
towards animals that are weaker than itself, that, when it
finds itself in a flock of sheep, it will remove with its trunk
those that are in the way, lest it should unintentionally
trample upon them. They will never do any mischief except
when provoked, and they are of a disposition so sociable, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
they always move about in herds, no animal being less fond
of a solitary life. When surrounded by a troop of horsemen,
they place in the centre of the herd those that are weak,
weary, or wounded, and then take the front rank each in its
turn, just as though they acted under command and in accordance
with discipline.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE WAY IN WHICH ELEPHANTS ARE CAUGHT.</h2>
<p>In India they are caught by the keeper guiding one of the
tame elephants towards a wild one which he has found alone
or has separated from the herd; upon which he beats it, and
when it is fatigued mounts and manages it just the same way
as the other. In Africa they take them in pit-falls; but as
soon as an elephant gets into one, the others immediately collect
boughs of trees and pile up heaps of earth, so as to form
a mound, and then endeavor with all their might to drag him
out. It was formerly the practice to tame them by driving
the herds with horsemen into a narrow defile, artificially made
in such a way as to deceive them by its length; and when
thus enclosed by means of steep banks and trenches, they
were rendered tame by the effects of hunger; as a proof of
which, they would quietly take a branch that was extended to
them by one of the men. At the present day, when we take
them for the sake of their tusks, we throw darts at their feet,
which are in general the most tender part of their body.
The Troglodyt&aelig;, who inhabit the confines of &AElig;thiopia, and
who live entirely on the flesh of elephants procured by the
chase, climb the trees which lie near the paths through which
these animals usually pass. Here they keep a watch, and
look out for the one which comes last in the train; leaping
down upon its haunches, they seize its tail with the left hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
and fix their feet firmly upon the left thigh. Hanging down
in this manner, the man, with his right hand, hamstrings the
animal on one side, with a very sharp hatchet. The elephant&rsquo;s
pace being retarded by the wound, he then cuts the
tendons of the other ham, and makes his escape; all of which
is done with the very greatest celerity.</p>
<p>Elephants of furious temper are tamed by hunger and
blows, while other elephants are placed near to keep them
quiet, when the violent fit is upon them, by means of chains.
Elephants, when tamed, are employed in war, and carry into
the ranks of the enemy towers filled with armed men; and on
them, in a very great measure, depends the ultimate result of
the battles that are fought in the East. They tread under
foot whole companies, and crush the men in their armor.
The very least sound, however, of the grunting of the hog terrifies
them: when wounded and panic-stricken, they invariably
fall back, and become no less formidable for the destruction
which they deal to their own side, than to their opponents.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE AGE OF THE ELEPHANT, AND OTHER PARTICULARS.</h2>
<p>Aristotle says that the elephant lives to the age of two
hundred years, and in some instances the extraordinary age of
three hundred years has been attained. The elephant is in
his prime at his sixtieth year. They are especially fond of
water, and wander much about streams, although they are
unable to swim, in consequence of their bulk.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> They are
particularly sensitive to cold, which is really their greatest
enemy. The trunks and foliage of trees are their favorite
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
food. They throw down with a blow from their forehead,
palms of exceedingly great height, and strip them of their
fruit.</p>
<p>They eat with the mouth, but they breathe and smell with
the proboscis which is not unaptly termed their &ldquo;hand.&rdquo;
This they use as a drinking cup, for they suck the fluid into
the cavity of the trunk, and bend the trunk into the mouth,
where the water is received and swallowed in the usual manner.
They have the greatest aversion to the mouse of all animals,
and quite loathe their food, as it lies in the manger, if they
perceive that it has been touched by one of these. They
experience the greatest torture if they happen to swallow,
while drinking, a horseleech, an animal which people are
beginning, I find, to call almost universally a &ldquo;blood-sucker.&rdquo;
The leech fastens upon the wind-pipe, and produces intolerable
pain.</p>
<p>The skin of the back is extremely hard, that of the belly is
softer. They are not covered with any kind of bristles, nor
does the slender tail furnish them with any protection from
the annoyance of flies; for vast as these animals are, they
suffer greatly from them. Their skin is reticulated, and
invites these insects by the odor it exhales. However, when
a swarm of flies has settled on the skin, while it is extended
and smooth, the elephant suddenly contracts it; and, in this
way, the flies are crushed between the folds which are thus
closed. This power serves them in place of tail, mane, and
hair.</p>
<p>Luxury has discovered a curious recommendation in this
animal, having found a particularly delicate flavor in the cartilaginous
part of the trunk, for no other reason, in my belief,
than because it fancies itself to be eating ivory. Tusks of
enormous size are constantly to be seen in the temples; and
in the extreme parts of Africa, on the confines of &AElig;thiopia,
they are employed as door-posts for houses.</p>

<h2 id="c25"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE LION.</h2>
<p>I think that I ought here to make some further mention
of Aristotle, seeing that upon these subjects, I intend, in a
great measure, to make him my guide. Alexander the Great,
filled with a strong desire to become acquainted with the
natures of animals, entrusted the prosecution of this design
to Aristotle, a man who held the highest rank in every branch
of learning; for which purpose he placed under his command
some thousands of men in every region of Asia and Greece,
comprising all those who followed the business of hunting,
fowling, or fishing, or who had the care of parks, herds of cattle,
the breeding of bees, fish-ponds, and aviaries, in order
that no creature that was known to exist might escape his
notice. By means of the information which he obtained
from these persons, he was enabled to compose some fifty volumes,
which are deservedly esteemed, on the subject of animals;
of these I purpose to give an epitome, together with
other facts with which Aristotle was unacquainted; and I beg
the kind indulgence of my readers in their estimate of this
work of mine, as by my aid they hastily travel through all the
works of nature, and through the midst of subjects with which
that most famous of all kings so ardently desired to be acquainted.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact, that pards, panthers, lions, and
other animals of this kind have retractile claws, so that they
can walk with the points of their nails concealed in a sheath
in the paw, thus preventing them from becoming broken or
blunted.</p>
<p>The noble appearance of the lion is especially to be seen in
the male, who has the neck and shoulders covered with a
mane.</p>
<p>The lion is the only one of all the wild beasts that shows
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
mercy to the suppliant; after it has conquered, it will spare,
and when enraged, it will vent its fury rather upon men than
women, and never upon children, unless when greatly pressed
by hunger. It is the belief in Libya, that it fully understands
the entreaties which are addressed to it. At all events, I
have heard it asserted as a fact, that a female slave, who was
returning from G&aelig;tulia, was attacked by a number of lions in
the forests; upon which she summoned sufficient courage to
address them, and said that she was a woman, a fugitive, helpless
creature, that she implored the compassion of the most
generous of animals,
the one that has the
command of all the
others, and that she
was a prey unworthy
of their high repute&mdash;and
by these means effectually
soothed their
ferocity.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> There are
various opinions on
this point, as to
whether it is through
some peculiar disposition
of the animals, or merely by accident, that their fury is
thus soothed by addressing them. As to what is alleged,
too, about serpents, that they can be drawn from their holes
by singing, and thus be made to yield themselves up to death,
the truth or falsity of it has not by any means been satisfactorily
ascertained.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/i_p072.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="473" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">GAMBIAN LION.</span>&mdash;<i>Leo Gambianus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The tail of the lion gives indication of the state of his feelings,
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
just as the ears do in the horse; for these are the distinguishing
signs which Nature has given to each of the most
generous of animals. Hence it is that, when pleased, the tail
is without motion, and the animal fawns upon those who
caress him; a thing, however, that very rarely happens, for
his usual state is that of rage. He begins by beating the
earth with his tail; and as he becomes more furious, he lashes
his sides, as if trying to excite himself. His greatest strength
is situated in the breast. When his hunger is satisfied, he
becomes harmless. The generous disposition of the lion is
especially manifested in time of danger; at the moment when,
despising all weapons, he long defends himself solely by the
great terror which he inspires, starting up at last, not as
though constrained by danger, but as if enraged by the mad
folly of his adversaries. This, however, is a still more noble
feature of his courage&mdash;however numerous the dogs and
hunters may be that press upon him, as he makes his retreat
he comes to a stand every now and then upon the level plain,
while he is still in view, and scowls contemptuously upon
them: but as soon as he has entered the thickets and dense
forests, he scours away at the swiftest possible pace, as
though aware that the place itself will shelter his shame.
When in pursuit, the lion advances with a leap, but he does
not do so when in flight. When wounded, he discovers, with
wonderful sagacity, the person who struck the blow, and will
find him out, however great may have been the multitude of
his pursuers. If a person has thrown a dart at him, but has
failed to inflict a wound, the animal seizes him, whirls him
round and throws him to the ground, but without wounding
him. When the lioness is defending her whelps, it is said
that she fixes her eyes steadily on the ground, that she may
not be frightened at the spears of the hunters. In all other
respects, these animals are equally free from deceit and suspicion.
They never look at an object obliquely, and they
dislike being looked at themselves in such a manner. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
generally believed, that, when the lion is dying, he bites at
the earth, and sheds tears at his fate. Powerful, however,
and fierce as this animal is, he is terrified by the motion of
wheels or of an empty chariot, and still more on seeing the
crest or hearing the crowing of a cock; but most of all, is he
afraid of fire. The only malady to which the lion is subject,
is loss of appetite; this, however, is cured by putting
insults upon him, by means of the pranks of monkeys placed
about him, a thing which rouses his anger; and as soon as he
tastes their blood, he is relieved.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />WONDERFUL FEATS PERFORMED BY LIONS.</h2>
<p>It was formerly a very difficult matter to catch the lion,
and it was mostly done by means of pit-falls. In the reign,
however, of the Emperor Claudius, accident disclosed a
method which appears almost disgraceful to the name of such
an animal; a G&aelig;tulian shepherd stopped a lion, that was
rushing furiously upon him, by merely throwing his cloak
over the animal; a circumstance which afterwards afforded an
exhibition in the arena of the Circus, when the frantic fury of
the animal was paralyzed in a manner almost incredible by a
light covering being thrown over its head, so that it could
be put into chains without the least resistance. This circumstance
renders what was done by Lysimachus less wonderful,
who strangled a lion, with which he had been shut up
by command of Alexander.</p>
<p>Antony subjected lions to the yoke, and was the first at
Rome to harness them to his chariot; and this during the
civil war, after the battle on the plains of Pharsalia; not,
indeed, without a kind of ominous presage, a prodigy that
foretold at the time that generous spirits were about to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
subdued. But to have himself drawn along in this manner,
in company with the actress Cytheris, was a thing that surpassed
even the monstrous spectacles that were to be seen at
that calamitous period. It is said that Hanno, one of the
most illustrious of the Carthaginians, was the first who ventured
to touch the lion with the hand, and to exhibit it in a
tame state. It was on this account that he was banished;
for it was supposed, that a man so talented and so ingenious
would have it in his power to persuade the people to anything,
and it was looked upon as unsafe to trust the liberties
of the country to one
who had so eminently
triumphed over even
ferocity itself. There
have been some fortuitous
occurrences cited
which have given occasion
to these animals
to display their natural
clemency. Mentor, a
native of Syracuse, was met in Syria by a lion, who rolled
before him in a suppliant manner; though smitten with fear
and desirous to escape, the wild beast on every side opposed
his flight, and licked his feet with a fawning air. Upon this,
Mentor observed on the paw of the lion a swelling and a
wound; from which, after extracting a splinter, he relieved
the creature&rsquo;s pain. There is a picture at Syracuse, which
bears witness to the truth of this occurrence.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i_p075.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">WILD CAT.</span>&mdash;<i>Felis Catus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In the same manner, too, Elpis, a native of Samos, on landing
from a vessel on the coast of Africa, observed a lion near
the beach, opening his mouth in a threatening manner; upon
which he climbed a tree, in the hope of escaping, while, at the
same time, he invoked the aid of Father Liber; for it is the
appropriate time for invocations when there is no room left
for hope. The wild beast did not pursue him as he fled,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
although he might easily have done so; but, lying down at
the foot of the tree, tried by the open mouth which had
caused so much terror, to excite his compassion. It appeared
that while he was devouring his food with too great avidity, a
bone had stuck fast between his teeth, and he was perishing
with hunger. Elpis, although he understood his mute entreaties,
did not dare to risk trusting himself to so formidable a
beast, so he remained stationary for some time, more from
astonishment than from fear. At length, however, he descended
from the tree and extracted the bone, the lion in the
mean while extending his head, and aiding in the operation as
far as it was necessary for him to do. The story goes on to
say, that as long as the vessel remained off that coast, the lion
showed his sense of gratitude by bringing to it whatever he
had chanced to procure in the chase. In memory of this circumstance,
Elpis consecrated a temple at Samos to Father
Liber, which the Greeks, from the circumstance above related,
called &ldquo;the temple <span title="kech&ecirc;notos Dionyson" class="g">&kappa;&epsilon;&chi;&eta;&nu;&#8057;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;&#8059;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;</span>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;temple of the open-mouthed
Bacchus.&rdquo; Can we wonder, after this, that the wild
beasts should be able to recognize the footsteps of man, when
of him alone of all animals they even hope for aid? For why
should they not have recourse to others for assistance? Or
how is it that they know that the hand of man has power to
heal them? Unless, perhaps, it is that the violence of pain
can force even wild beasts to risk everything to obtain relief.</p>
<p>Demetrius, the natural philosopher, relates an equally remarkable
instance, in relation to a panther. The animal was
lying in the middle of the road, waiting for some one to pass
that way, when he was suddenly perceived by the father of
one Philinus, an ardent lover of wisdom. Seized with fear, he
immediately began to retreat; while the beast rolled itself
before him, evidently with the desire of caressing him, at the
same time manifesting signs of grief, which could not be misunderstood
even in a panther. The animal had young ones,
which had happened to fall into a pit at some distance from
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
the place. The first dictates of compassion banished all fear,
and the next prompted him to assist the animal. He accordingly
followed her, as she gently drew him on by fixing her
claws in his garment; and as soon as he discovered what was
the cause of her grief and the price of his own safety, he took
the whelps out of the pit, and they followed her to the end of
the desert; whither he was escorted by her, frisking with joy
and gladness, in order that she might more appropriately
testify how grateful she was, and how little she had given
him in return; a mode
of acting which is but
rarely found even
among men.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">MARGAY.</span>&mdash;<i>Leopardus Tigrinus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Facts such as these
induce us to give some
credit to what Democritus
relates, who says
that a man, called
Thoas, was preserved
in Arcadia by a dragon. When a boy, he had become much
attached to it, and had reared it very tenderly; but his father,
being alarmed at the nature and monstrous size of the reptile,
had it taken away and left in the desert. Thoas being here
attacked by some robbers who lay in ambush, he was delivered
from them by the dragon, which recognized his voice and
came to his assistance. But as to what has been said respecting
infants that have been exposed and nourished by the milk
of wild beasts, as in the case of the founders of our city by
a wolf, I am disposed to attribute such cases as these rather
to the greatness of the destinies which have to be fulfilled,
than to any peculiarity in the nature of the animals themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>

<br />PANTHERS AND TIGERS.</h2>
<p>The panther and the tiger are nearly the only animals that
are remarkable for a skin distinguished by the variety of its
spots; whereas others have them of a single color, appropriate
to each species.
The lions of Syria
alone are black. The
spots of the panther
are like small eyes, upon
a white ground. It
is said that all quadrupeds
are terrified by
the fierceness of their
aspect; for which reason
the creature conceals
its head, and then
springs unexpectedly
upon its prey. It is
said by some, that the
panther has, on the
shoulder, a spot which
bears the form of the
moon; and that, like
it, it regularly increases
to full, and then diminishes to a crescent. At present we
apply the general names of varia and pard to all the numerous
species of this animal, which are very common in Africa
and Syria. Some writers distinguish the panther as being
remarkable for its whiteness: and as yet I have not observed
any other difference between them.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">JAGUAR.</span>&mdash;<i>Leopardus Onca.</i></p>

<p>There was an ancient decree of the senate, which prohibited
animals being imported from Africa into Italy; but Cn&aelig;us
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
Aufidius, the tribune of the people, procured a law repealing
this, which allowed of their being brought over for the games
of the Circus. Scaurus, in his &aelig;dileship, was the first who
sent over the parti-colored kind, one hundred and fifty in all;
after which, Pompey sent four hundred and ten, and the late
Emperor Augustus four hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>The same emperor was the first person who exhibited at
Rome a tame tiger on the stage. This was in the consulship
of Tubero and Fabius Maximus, at the dedication of the theatre
of Marcellus, on
the fourth day before
the nones of May: the
late Emperor Claudius
exhibited four at one
time.</p>

<p>Hyrcania and India
produce the tiger, an
animal of tremendous
swiftness, a quality
which is more especially
tested when we
deprive it of all its
whelps, which are always very numerous. They are seized
by the hunter, who lies in wait for them, being provided
with the fleetest horse he can possibly obtain, and which he
frequently changes for a fresh one. As soon as the female
finds her lair empty&mdash;for the male takes no care whatever
of his offspring&mdash;headlong she darts forth, and traces them
by the smell. Her approach is made known by her cries,
upon which the hunter throws down one of the whelps; this
she snatches up with her teeth, and more swift, even, under
the weight, returns to her lair, and sets out in pursuit again;
this she continues to do, until the hunter has reached his
vessel, while the animal vainly vents her fury upon the shore.</p>

<br />THE CAMEL.</h2>
<p>Camels are found feeding in herds in the East. Of these
there are two different kinds, the Bactrian and the Arabian;
the former kind having two humps on the back, the latter
only one; they have also another hump under the breast, by
means of which they support themselves when reclining.
Both of these species,
like the ox, have no
teeth in the upper jaw.
They are all of them
employed as beasts of
burthen, in carrying
loads on the back, and
they answer the purpose
of cavalry in battle.
Their speed is the
same with that of the
horse, but their power
of holding out in this
respect is proportioned in each to its natural strength: it will
never go beyond its accustomed distance, nor will it receive
more than its usual load. The camel can endure thirst for
four days, and when it has the opportunity of obtaining water,
it drinks, as it were, both for past and future thirst, having
first taken care to trouble the water by trampling in it; without
doing which, it would find no pleasure in drinking. They
live fifty years, some indeed as much as one hundred.</p>

to the camel. One of these is called, by the &AElig;thiopians, the
nabun. It has a neck like that of the horse, feet and legs like
those of the ox, a head like that of the camel, and is covered
with white spots upon a red ground; from which peculiarities
it has been called the cameleopard.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> It was first seen at
Rome in the Circensian games held by C&aelig;sar, the Dictator.
Since that time too, it has been occasionally seen. It is remarkable
for the singularity of its appearance, and from its
very wild disposition it has obtained the name of the wild
sheep.</p>

<p>At the games of Pompey the rhinoceros, an animal which
has a single horn projecting from the nose, was also exhibited;
it has been frequently seen since then. This is a natural-born
enemy of the elephant.
It prepares itself for
the combat by sharpening
its horn against
the rocks; and in fighting
directs it chiefly
against the belly of its
adversary, which it
knows to be the softest
part. The two
animals are of equal
length, but the legs of
the rhinoceros are
much the shorter: its skin is the color of box-wood.</p>

<p>&AElig;thiopia produces the crocotta, an animal which looks as
though it were a cross between the wolf and the dog, for it
can break anything with its teeth, and instantly on swallowing
it digest it with its stomach; monkeys, too, with black
heads, the hair of the ass, and a voice quite unlike that of
any other animal. And there are oxen, like those of India,
some with one horn, and others with three; the leucrocotta, a
wild beast of extraordinary swiftness, the size of the wild ass,
with the legs of a stag, the neck, tail, and breast of a lion, the
head of a badger, a cloven hoof, the mouth slit up as far as
the ears, and one continuous
bone instead
of teeth;<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> it is said,
too, that this animal
can imitate the human
voice. Among the
same people, there is
also found an animal
called eale; it is the
size of the river-horse,
has the tail of the elephant,
and is of a black
or tawny color. It has
also the jaws of the wild boar, and horns that are movable,
and more than a cubit in length, so that, in fighting, it can
employ them alternately, and vary their position by presenting
them directly or obliquely, according as necessity may
dictate. But the wild bulls which this country produces are
the fiercest of all; they are larger than our domestic bull, and
exceed all the others in swiftness; are of a tawny color, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
azure eyes, and the hair turned the contrary way; while the
jaws open as far as the ears, and the horns are as movable
as those of the eale. The hide of this animal is as hard
as flint, and effectually resists all wounds. These creatures
pursue all the other wild beasts, while they themselves can
only be taken in pitfalls, where they always perish from excess
of rage. Ctesias informs us, that among these same
&AElig;thiopians, an animal is found, which he calls the mantichora;<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a>
it has a triple row of teeth, which fit into each other
like those of a comb, the face and ears of a man, and azure
eyes, is of the color of blood, has the body of the lion, and a
tail ending in a sting, like that of the scorpion. Its voice
resembles the union of the sound of the flute and the
trumpet; it is of excessive swiftness, and is particularly fond
of human flesh.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="large">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />THE ANIMALS OF &AElig;THIOPIA; WILD BEASTS WHICH KILL WITH THEIR EYES.</h2>
<p>Among the Hesperian &AElig;thiopians is the fountain of
Nigris, by many, supposed to be the head of the Nile. Near
this fountain, there is found a wild beast, which is called the
catoblepas; an animal of moderate size, but its head is
remarkably heavy, and it only carries it with the greatest difficulty,
being always bent down towards the earth. Were it
not for this circumstance, it would prove the destruction of
the human race; for all who behold its eyes, fall dead upon
the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>There is the same power also in the serpent called the basilisk.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a>
It is produced in the province of Cyrene, being not
more than twelve fingers in length. It has a white spot on
the head, strongly resembling a sort of a diadem. When it
hisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not
advance its body, like the others, by a succession of folds, but
moves along upright and erect upon the middle. It destroys
all shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that it has
breathed upon; it burns up all the grass too, and breaks the
stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerly
a general belief that if a man on horseback killed one
of these animals with a spear, the poison would run up the
weapon and kill, not only the rider, but the horse as well.
To this dreadful monster the odor of the weasel is fatal, a
thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often
desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has
pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote.
The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk,
which is easily known from the soil around it being infected.
The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odor, but dies itself in
this struggle of nature against its own self.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="large">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />WOLVES; SERPENTS.</h2>
<p>In Italy also it is believed that there is a noxious influence
in the eye of a wolf; it is supposed that it will instantly take
away the voice of a man, if it is the first to see him.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> Africa
and Egypt produce wolves of a sluggish and stunted nature;
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
those of the colder climates are fierce and savage. That
men have been turned into wolves, and again restored to
their original form, we must confidently look upon as untrue,
unless, indeed, we are ready to believe all the tales, which,
for so many ages, have been found to be fabulous. But, as
the belief of it has become so firmly fixed in the minds of the
common people, as to have caused the term &ldquo;Versipellis&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a>
to be used as a common form of imprecation, I will here
point out its origin. Euanthes, a Grecian author of no mean
reputation, informs us that the Arcadians assert that a
member of the family of Anthus is chosen by lot, and then
taken to a certain lake in that district, where, after suspending
his clothes on an oak, he swims across the water and goes
away into the desert, where he is changed into a wolf and
associates with other animals of the same species for a space
of nine years. If he has kept himself from beholding a man
during the whole of that time, he returns to the same lake,
and, after swimming across it, resumes his original form, only
with the addition of nine years in age to his former appearance.
To this Fabius adds, that he takes his former clothes
as well. It is really wonderful to what a length the credulity<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a>
of the Greeks will go! There is no falsehood, if ever
so barefaced, to which some of them cannot be found to bear
testimony.</p>
<p>So, too, Agriopas informs us that Dem&aelig;netus, the Parrhasian,
during a sacrifice of human victims, which the Arcadians
were offering up to the Lyc&aelig;an Jupiter, tasted the
entrails of a boy who had been slaughtered; upon which he
was turned into a wolf, but, ten years afterwards, was
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
restored to his original shape and his calling of an athlete,
and returned victorious in the pugilistic contests at the
Olympic games.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/i_p087.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="303" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">VIPER, OR ADDER.</span>&mdash;<i>Pelias Berus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>With reference to serpents, it is generally known, that
they assume the color of the soil in which they conceal themselves.
The different species of them are innumerable. The
cerastes has little horns, often four in number, projecting
from the body, by the movement of which it attracts birds,
while the rest of its body lies concealed. The amphisb&aelig;na
has two heads, that is to say, it has a second one at the tail,
as though one mouth were too little for the discharge of all
its venom. Some serpents
have scales, some
a mottled skin, and
they are all possessed
of a deadly poison.
The jaculus<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> darts
from the branches of
trees; and it is not
only to our feet that
the serpent is formidable, for he even flies through the air
just as though he were hurled from an engine. The neck
of the asp puffs out, and there is no remedy whatever against
its sting, except the instant excision of the affected part.
This reptile, which is so deadly, is possessed of this one
sense, or rather affection; the male and the female are generally
found together, and the one cannot live without the
other; hence it is that, if one of them happens to be killed,
the other takes incredible pains to avenge its death. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
follows the slayer of its mate, and will single him out
among never so large a number of people, by a sort of
instinctive knowledge; with this object it overcomes all difficulties,
travels any distance, and is only to be avoided by the
intervention of rivers or an accelerated flight. It is really
difficult to decide, whether Nature has altogether been more
liberal of good or of evil. First of all, however, she has
given to this pest but weak powers of sight, and has placed
the eyes, not in the front of the head, so that it may see
straight before it, but in the temples, so that it is more frequently
put in motion by the approach of the footstep than
through the sight. The ichneumon, however, is its enemy
to the very death.</p>
<p>This hostility is the especial glory of this animal, which is
also produced in Egypt. It plunges itself repeatedly into
the mud, and then dries itself in the sun: as soon as, by
these means, it has armed itself with a sufficient number of
coatings, it proceeds to the combat. Raising its tail, and
turning its back to the serpent, it receives its stings, which
are inflicted to no purpose, until at last, turning its head sideways,
and viewing its enemy, it seizes it by the throat. Not
content, however, with this victory, it conquers another creature,
the crocodile, which is no less dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="large">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE CROCODILE AND THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</h2>
<p>The Nile produces the crocodile, a destructive quadruped,
and equally dangerous on land and in the water. This is the
only land animal that does not enjoy the use of its tongue,<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
and the only one that has the upper jaw movable, and is
capable of biting with it; and terrible is its bite, for the rows
of its teeth fit into each other, like those of a comb. Its
length exceeds eighteen cubits. It produces eggs about the
size of those of the goose, and, by a kind of instinctive foresight,
always deposits them beyond the limit to which the
river Nile rises, when at its greatest height. There is no
animal that arrives at so great a bulk as this, from so small a
beginning. It is armed also with claws, and has a skin, that
is proof against all blows. It passes the day on land, and the
night in the water, in both instances on account of the
warmth. When it has glutted itself with fish, it goes to sleep
on the banks of the river, a portion of the food always
remaining in its mouth; upon which, a little bird, which in
Egypt is known as the trochilus, and, in Italy, as the king of
the birds, for the purpose of obtaining food, invites the crocodile
to open its jaws; then, hopping to and fro, it first cleans
the outside of its mouth, next the teeth, and then the inside,
while the animal opens its jaws as wide as possible, in consequence
of the pleasure which it experiences from the titillation.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a>
It is at these moments that the ichneumon, seeing it
fast asleep in consequence of the agreeable sensation thus
produced, darts down its throat like an arrow, and eats away
its intestines.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<p>Like the crocodile, but smaller even than the ichneumon, is
the scincus, which is also produced in the Nile, and the flesh
of which is the most effectual antidote against poisons. But
so great a pest was the crocodile to prove, that Nature was
not content with giving it one enemy only; the dolphins,
therefore, which enter the Nile, have the back armed with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
spine,<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> which is edged like a knife, as if for this very purpose;
and although these animals are much inferior in
strength, they contrive to destroy the crocodile by artifice,
which on the other hand attempts to drive them from their
prey, and would reign alone in its river as its peculiar
domain. For all animals have an especial instinct in this
respect, and are able to know not only what is for their own
advantage, but also what is to the disadvantage of their
enemies; they fully understand the use of their own weapons,
they know their opportunity, and the weak parts of those
with which they have to contend.</p>
<p>The skin of the belly of the crocodile is soft and thin;
aware of this, the dolphins plunge into the water, as if in
great alarm, and diving beneath its belly, tear it open with
their spines. There is a race of men also, who are peculiarly
hostile to the crocodile; they are known as the Tentyrit&aelig;,
from an island in the Nile which they inhabit. These men
are of small stature, but of wonderful presence of mind,
though for this particular object only. The crocodile is a
terrible animal to those who fly from it, while at the same
time it will fly from those who pursue it; these, however, are
the only people who dare to attack it. They even swim in
the river after it, and mount its back like so many horsemen;
and just as the animal turns up its head for the purpose of
biting them, they insert a club into its mouth, holding which
at each end, with the two hands, it acts like a bit, and by
these means they drive the captured animal on shore. They
also terrify the crocodile so much even by their voice alone,
as to force it to disgorge the bodies which it has lately swallowed,
for the purpose of burial. This island, therefore, is
the only place near which the crocodile never swims; for it is
repelled by the odor of this race of men. The sight of the
animal is said to be dull when it is in the water, but, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
out of the water, piercing in the extreme; it always passes
the four winter months in a cave, without taking food.
Some persons say, that this is the only animal that continues
to increase in size as long as it lives; it is very long-lived.</p>
<p>The Nile produces the hippopotamus, another wild beast,
of a still greater size. It has the cloven hoof of the ox; the
back, the mane, and the neighing of the horse; and the
turned-up snout, the tail, and the hooked teeth of the wild
boar, but is not so dangerous. The hide is impenetrable,
except when it has been soaked with water; and it is used for
making shields and
helmets. This animal
lays waste the standing
corn, and determines
beforehand what part
it shall ravage on the
following day; it is
said also, that it enters
the field backwards, to
prevent any ambush
being laid for it on its
return.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">HIPPOPOTAMUS, OR ZEEKOE.</span>&mdash;<i>Hippopotamus Amphibius.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Marcus Scaurus was
the first to exhibit this animal at Rome, together with five
crocodiles, at the games which he gave in his &aelig;dileship, in a
piece of water which had been temporarily prepared for the
purpose. The hippopotamus has even been our instructor in
one of the operations of medicine. When the animal has become
too bulky by continued overfeeding, it goes down to
the banks of the river, and examines the reeds which have
been newly cut; as soon as it has found a stump that is very
sharp, it presses its body against it, and so wounds one of the
veins in the thigh; and, by the flow of blood thus produced,
the body, which would otherwise have fallen into a morbid
state, is relieved; after which, it covers up the wound with mud.</p>

<h2 id="c33"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />PROGNOSTICS OF DANGER DERIVED FROM ANIMALS.</h2>
<p>Nature has bestowed upon many animals the faculty of
observing the heavens, and of presaging the winds, rains, and
tempests, each in its own peculiar way. It would be an endless
labor to enumerate them all; just as much as it would
be to point out the relation of each to man. For, in fact,
they warn us of danger, not only by their fibres and their
entrails, to which a
large portion of mankind
attach the greatest
faith, but by other
kinds of warnings as
well. When a building
is about to fall
down, all the mice desert
it, and the spiders
with their webs are the
first to drop. Divination
from birds has been made a science among the Romans,
and the college of its priests is looked upon as peculiarly
sacred. In Thrace, when all parts are covered with ice, the
foxes are consulted, an animal which, in other respects, is
baneful from its craftiness. It has been observed, that this
animal applies its ear to the ice, for the purpose of testing
its thickness; and the inhabitants will never cross frozen
rivers and lakes until the foxes have passed over them and
returned.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i_p092.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="364" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">COMMON MOUSE.</span>&mdash;<i>Mus M&uacute;sculus</i> (White, Brown and Pied Varieties).</p>
</div>
<p>We have accounts, too, no less remarkable, in reference
even to the most contemptible of animals. Marcus Varro
informs us, that a town in Spain was undermined by rabbits,
and one in Thessaly, by mice; that the inhabitants of a district
in Gaul were driven from their country by frogs, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
place in Africa by locusts; that the inhabitants of Gyarus,
one of the Cyclades, were driven away by mice; and the
Amuncl&aelig;, in Italy, by serpents. There is a vast desert tract
on this side of the &AElig;thiopian Cynamolgi, the inhabitants of
which were exterminated by scorpions and venomous ants,
and Theophrastus informs us, that the people of Rh&oelig;teum
were driven away by multipede insects. But we must now
return to the other kinds of wild beasts.</p>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />THE HY&AElig;NA.</h2>
<p>The neck of the hy&aelig;na with the mane, runs continuously
into the back-bone, so that the animal cannot bend this part
without turning round the whole body. Many wonderful
things are also related of this animal; and strangest of all,
that it imitates the human voice among the stalls of the
shepherds; and while there, learns the name of some one of
them, and then calls him away, and devours him. It is said
also, that it can imitate a man vomiting, and that, in this way,
it attracts the dogs, and then falls upon them. It is the only
animal that digs up graves, in order to obtain the bodies of
the dead. The female is rarely caught: its eyes, it is said,
are of a thousand various colors and changes of shade. It
is said also, that on coming in contact with its shadow, dogs
will lose their voice, and that, by certain magical influences,
it can render any animal immovable, round which it has
walked three times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="large">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />DEER.</h2>
<p>The deer, although the mildest of all animals, has still its
own feelings of malignancy; when hard pressed by the
hounds it flies of its own accord for refuge to man. The
deer exercise the young ones in running, and teach them how
to take to flight, leading them to precipices, and showing them
how to leap. When the stags feel themselves becoming too
fat, they seek some retired spot, thus acknowledging the
inconvenience arising from their bulk. Besides this, they
continually pause in their flight, stand still and look back,
and then again resume their flight, when the enemy approaches.
The barking of a dog instantly puts them to flight,
and they always run with the wind, in order that no trace of
them may be left. They are soothed by the shepherd&rsquo;s pipe
and his song; when their ears are erect, their sense of hearing
is very acute, but when dropped, they become deaf.</p>
<p>In other respects the deer is a simple animal, which regards
everything as wonderful, and with a stupid astonishment;
so much so, that if a horse or cow happens to approach
it, it will not see the hunter, who may be close at
hand, or, if it does see him, it only gazes upon his bow and
arrow. Deer cross the sea in herds, swimming in a long line,
the head of each resting on the haunches of the one that precedes
it, each in its turn falling back to the rear. This has
been particularly remarked when they pass over from Cilicia
to the island of Cyprus. Though they do not see the land,
they still are able to direct themselves by the smell. The
males have horns, and are the only animals that shed them
every year, at a stated time in the spring; at which period
they seek out with the greatest care the most retired places,
and after losing them, remain concealed, as though aware
that they are unarmed. They also bear the marks of their
age on the horns, every year, up to the sixth,<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> a fresh antler
being added; after which period the horns are renewed in
the same state, so that by means of them their age cannot be
ascertained. Their old age, however, is indicated by their
teeth, for then they have only a few, or none at all; and we
then no longer perceive, at the base of their horns, antlers
projecting from the front of the forehead, as is usually the
case with the animal when young.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i_p095.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="768" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">CARIBOU.</span>&mdash;<i>Larandus Rangifer.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>When the horns begin to be reproduced, two projections
are to be seen, much resembling, at first, dry skin; they grow
with tender shoots, having upon them a soft, velvety down
like that on the head of a reed. So long as they are without
horns, they go to feed during the night. As the horns grow,
they harden by the heat of the sun, and the animal, from
time to time, tries their strength upon the trees; when satisfied
with their strength, it leaves its retreat.</p>
<p>Stags, too, have been occasionally caught with ivy, green
and growing, on their horns,<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a> the plant having taken root on
them, as it would on any piece of wood, while the animal
was rubbing them against the trees. The stag is sometimes
found white, as is said to have been the case with the hind
of Sertorius, which he persuaded the nations of Spain to look
upon as having the gift of prophecy.</p>
<p>The stag is generally admitted to be very long lived; some
were captured at the end of one hundred years with the
golden collars which Alexander the Great had put upon them,
and which were quite concealed by the folds of the skin, in
consequence of the accumulation of fat.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />THE CHAMELEON.</h2>
<p>Africa is almost the only country that does not produce
the stag, but it produces the chameleon, which, however, is
much more commonly met with in India. Its figure and size
are that of a lizard, only that its legs are straight and longer.
Its sides unite under its belly, as in fishes, and its spine projects
in a similar manner. Its muzzle is not unlike the snout
of a small hog, so far as it can be in so small an animal. Its
tail is very long, and becomes smaller towards the end, coiling
up in folds like that of the viper. It has hooked claws,
and a slow movement like that of the tortoise; its body is
rough like that of the crocodile; its eyes are deep sunk in
the orbits, placed very near each other, very large, and of the
same color as the body. It never closes them, and when the
animal looks round, it does so, not by the motion of the
pupil, but of the white of the eye. It always holds the head
upright and the mouth open, and is the only animal which
receives nourishment neither by meat nor drink, nor anything
else, but from the air alone.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> Towards the end of the dog-days
it is fierce, but at other times quite harmless. The
nature of its color, too, is very remarkable, for it is continually
changing; its eyes, its tail, and its whole body always
assuming the color of whatever object is nearest, with the
exception of white and red.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> After death, it becomes of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
pale color. It has a little flesh about the head, the jaws, and
the root of the tail, but none whatever on the rest of the
body. It has no blood whatever, except in the heart and
about the eyes, and its entrails are without a spleen. It conceals
itself during the winter months, just like the lizard.</p>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />BEARS AND THEIR CUBS.</h2>
<p>The cubs of bears when first born are shapeless masses of
white flesh, a little larger than mice; their claws alone being
prominent. The mother then licks them gradually into
proper shape. Bears hibernate during three or four months
of the winter season. If they happen to have no den, they
construct a retreat with branches and shrubs, which is made
impenetrable to the rain and is lined with soft leaves. During
the first fourteen days they are overcome by so deep a sleep,
that they cannot be aroused even by wounds. They become
wonderfully fat, too, while in this lethargic state. This fat is
much used in medicine; and it is very useful in preventing
the hair from falling off. At the end of these fourteen days
they sit up, and find nourishment by sucking their fore-paws.
They warm their cubs, when cold, by pressing them to the
breast, not unlike the way in which birds brood over their
eggs. It is a very astonishing thing, but Theophrastus
believes it that if we preserve the flesh of the bear, the animal
being killed in its dormant state, it will increase in bulk,
even though it may have been cooked. During this period
no signs of food are to be found in the stomach of the animal,
and only a very slight quantity of liquid; there are a few
drops of blood only near the heart, but none whatever in any
other part of the body. They leave their retreat in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
spring, the males being remarkably fat: of this circumstance,
however, we cannot give any satisfactory explanation, for the
sleep, during which they increase so much in bulk, lasts, as
we have already stated, only fourteen days. When they
come out, they sharpen the edges of their teeth against the
young shoots of the trees. Their eye-sight is dull, for which
reason they seek the combs of bees, in order that from the
bees stinging them in the throat and drawing blood, the
oppression in the head may be relieved.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> The head of the
bear is extremely weak, whereas, in the lion, it is remarkable
for its strength: on
this account probably
when the bear, impelled
by any alarm,
is about to precipitate
itself from a rock, it
covers its head with
its paws. In the arena
of the Circus they are
often to be seen killed
by a blow on the head
with the fist. These
animals walk on two
feet, and climb down trees backwards. They can overcome
the bull, by suspending themselves, by all four legs, from
its muzzle and horns, thus wearing out its powers by their
weight. In no other animal is stupidity found more adroit
in devising mischief. It is recorded in our Annals, that in
the consulship of Piso and Messala, Domitius brought into
the Circus one hundred Numidian bears, and as many &AElig;thiopian
hunters.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">SYRIAN BEAR, OR DUBB.</span>&mdash;<i>Ursus Isabellinus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The mice of Pontus also conceal themselves during the
winter; but only the white ones. I wonder how those
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
authors, who have asserted that the sense of taste in these
animals is very acute, found out that such is the fact. The
Alpine mice (the marmot) which are the same size as badgers,
also conceal themselves; but they first carry a store of
provisions into their retreat. There is a similar animal also
in Egypt, which sits in the same way, upon its haunches, and
walks on two feet, using the fore feet as hands.</p>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />HEDGEHOGS.</h2>
<p>Hedgehogs also lay up food for the winter; rolling themselves
on apples as they lie on the ground, they pierce some
with their quills, and
then take up another
in the mouth, and so
carry them into the hollows
of trees. These
animals also, when they
conceal themselves in
their holes, afford a
sure sign that the
wind is about to change
from north-east to
south. When they perceive the approach of the hunter, they
draw in the head and feet, and all the lower part of the body,
which is covered by a thin and defenceless down only, and
then roll themselves up into the form of a ball, so that there
is no way of taking hold of them but by their quills.</p>

<p>They force it to unroll itself, by sprinkling warm water
upon it, and then, suspended by one of its hind legs, it is left
to die of hunger; for there is no other mode of destroying it,
without doing injury to its skin. This animal is not, as many
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
of us imagine, entirely useless to man. If it were not for the
quills which it produces, the soft fleece of the sheep would
have been given in vain to mankind; for it is by means of its
skin, that our woollen cloth is dressed. From the monopoly
of this article, great frauds and great profits have resulted;
there is no subject on which the senate has more frequently
passed decrees, and there is not one of the Emperors, who
has not received from the provinces complaints respecting it.</p>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />THE WILD BOAR.</h2>
<p>The flesh of the wild boar is much esteemed. Cato the
Censor, in his orations, strongly declaimed against the use of
the brawn of the wild boar. The animal used to be divided
into three portions, the
middle part of which
was laid by, and is
called boar&rsquo;s chine.
Publius Servilius Rullus
was the first Roman
who served up a whole
boar at a banquet; the
father of that Rullus,
who, in the consulship
of Cicero, proposed the Agrarian law. So recent is the introduction
of a thing which is now in daily use. The Annalists
have taken notice of such a fact as this, clearly as a hint to
us to mend our manners; seeing that now-a-days two or three
boars are consumed, not at one entertainment, but as forming
the first course only.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">WILD BOAR.</span>&mdash;<i>Sus Scrofa.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Fulvius Lupinus was the first Roman who formed parks for
the reception of these and other wild animals: he first fed
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
them in the territory of Tarquinii: it was not long, however,
before imitators were found in Lucullus and Hortensius.
The wild boar of India has two curved teeth, projecting from
beneath the muzzle, a cubit in length; and the same number
projecting from the forehead, like the horns of the young
bull. The hair of these animals, in a wild state, is the color
of copper, the others are black. No species whatever of the
swine is found in Arabia.</p>

<br />APES.</h2>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

</div>
<p>The different kinds of apes, which approach the nearest to
the human figure, are distinguished from each other by the
tail. Their shrewdness
is quite wonderful. It
is said that, imitating
the hunters, they will
besmear themselves
with bird-lime, and put
their feet into the shoes
which, as so many
snares, have been prepared
for them.<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> Mucianus
says, that they have even played at chess, having, by
practice, learned to distinguish the different pieces, which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
made of wax.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a> He says that the species which have tails
become quite melancholy when the moon is on the wane,
and that they leap for joy at the time of the new moon, and
adore it. Other quadrupeds also are terrified at the eclipses
of the heavenly bodies. All the species of apes manifest remarkable
affection for their offspring. Females, which have
been domesticated, and
have had young ones,
carry them about and
show them to all comers,
show great delight
when they are caressed,
and appear to understand
the kindness
thus shown them.
Hence it is, that they
very often stifle their
young with their embraces.
The dog-headed
ape is of a
much fiercer nature, as
is the case with the
satyr. The callitriche
or &ldquo;fine-haired monkey,&rdquo;
has almost a totally different aspect; it has a beard on
the face, and a tail, which in the first part of it is very bushy.
It is said that this animal cannot live except in the climate of
&AElig;thiopia, which is its native place.</p>

<br />DOMESTIC ANIMALS.</h2>
<h2 id="c41"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />THE DOG; EXAMPLES OF ITS ATTACHMENT TO ITS MASTER.</h2>
<p>Among the animals that are domesticated with mankind
have occurred many circumstances that deserve to be known.
Among these animals are more particularly those faithful
friends of man, the dog, and the horse. We have an account
of a dog that fought against a band of robbers, in defending
its master; and although it was pierced with wounds, still it
would not leave the body, from which it drove away all birds
and beasts. Another dog, in Epirus, recognized the murderer
of its master, in the midst of an assemblage of people, and,
by biting and barking at him, extorted from him a confession
of his crime. A king of the Garamantes was brought back
from exile by two hundred dogs, who maintained the combat
against all his opponents. The people of Colophon and Castabala
kept troops of dogs, for the purposes of war; and
these used to fight in the front rank, and never retreat; they
were the most faithful of auxiliaries, and yet required no pay.
After the defeat of the Cimbri, their dogs defended their
movable houses, which were carried upon wagons. When
Jason, the Lycian, had been slain, his dog refused to take
food, and died of famine. When the funeral pile of King
Lysimachus was lighted, his dog, to which Darius gives the
name of Hyrcanus, threw itself into the flames, and the dog
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
of King Hiero did the same. Philistus gives a similar
account of Pyrrhus, the dog of the tyrant Gelon.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/i_p105.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="482" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">MALTESE DOG.</span>&mdash;<i>Canis Famili&aacute;ris.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Among ourselves, Volcatius, a man of rank, who instructed
Cascellius in the civil law, as he was riding on his Asturian
jennet, towards evening, from his country-house, was attacked
by a robber, and was only saved by his dog. The senator
C&aelig;lius, too, while lying sick at Placentia, was surprised by
armed men, but received
not a wound
from them until they
had first killed his dog.
But a more extraordinary
fact than all, took
place in our own
times, and is testified
to by the public register
of the Roman
people. In the consulship
of Junius and
Silius, when Titius Sabinus
was put to death together with his slaves, for the affair
of Nero, the son of Germanicus, it was found impossible to
drive away a dog which belonged to one of them from the
prison; nor could it be forced away from the body, which
had been cast down the Gemitorian steps; but there it stood
howling, in the presence of vast multitudes of people; and
when some one threw a piece of bread to it, the animal carried
it to the mouth of its master. Afterwards, when the
body was thrown into the Tiber, the dog swam into the
river, and endeavored to raise it out of the water; quite a
throng of people gathered to witness this instance of an animal&rsquo;s
fidelity.</p>
<p>Dogs are the only animals that are sure to know their
masters; and if they suddenly meet him as a stranger they
will instantly recognize him. They are the only animals that
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
will answer to their names, and recognize the voices of the
family. They recollect a road along which they have passed,
however long it may be. Next to man, there is no living
creature whose memory is so retentive. By sitting down on
the ground, we may arrest their most impetuous attack, even
when prompted by the most violent rage.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/i_p106.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="491" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">THIBET DOG.</span>&mdash;<i>Canis Famili&aacute;ris.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In daily life we have discovered many other valuable qualities
in this animal; but its intelligence and sagacity are more
especially shown in the chase. It discovers and traces out
the tracks of the animal, leading by the leash the sportsman
who accompanies it
straight up to the prey;
and as soon as it has
perceived it, how silent
it is, and how secret
but significant is the
indication which it
gives, first by the tail
and afterwards by the
nose! Oftentimes
even when worn out
with old age, blind, and
feeble, they are carried
by the huntsman in his arms, being still able to point out
the coverts where the game is concealed, by snuffing with
their muzzles at the wind.</p>
<p>Among the Gauls their packs of hounds have, each of them,
one dog who acts as the guide and leader. This dog they
follow in the chase, and him they carefully obey; for these
animals have even a notion of subordination among themselves.
It is asserted that the dogs keep running when they
drink at the Nile, for fear of becoming a prey to the voracity
of the crocodile. When Alexander the Great was on his
Indian expedition, he was presented by the king of Albania
with a dog of unusual size; being greatly delighted with its
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
noble appearance, he ordered bears, and after them wild boars,
and then deer, to be let loose before it; but the dog lay
down, and regarded them with contempt. The noble spirit
of the general became irritated by the sluggishness thus manifested
by an animal of such vast bulk, and he ordered it to be
killed. The report of this reached the king, who accordingly
sent another dog, and at the same time sent word that its
powers were to be tried, not upon small animals, but upon the
lion or the elephant; adding that he had had originally but
two, and that if this one were put to death, the race would be
extinct. Alexander, without delay, procured a lion, which in
his presence was instantly torn to pieces. He then ordered
an elephant to be brought, and never was he more delighted
with any spectacle; for the dog, bristling up its hair all over
the body, began by thundering forth a loud barking, and then
attacked the animal, leaping at it first on one side and then
on the other, attacking it in the most skillful manner, and
then again retreating at the opportune moment, until at last
the elephant, being rendered quite giddy by turning round
and round, fell to the earth, and made it quite re-echo with
his fall.</p>
<h2 id="c42"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE HORSE.</h2>
<p>King Alexander had a very remarkable horse which was
called Bucephalus, either on account of the fierceness of its
aspect, or because it had the figure of a bull&rsquo;s head marked on
its shoulder. It is said, that he was struck with its beauty
when he was only a boy, and that it was purchased from the
stud of Philonicus, the Pharsalian, for thirteen talents.
When it was equipped with the royal trappings, it would
suffer no one except Alexander to mount it, although at
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
other times it would allow any one to do so. A memorable
circumstance connected with it in battle is recorded of this
horse; it is said that when it was wounded in the attack upon
Thebes, it would not allow Alexander to mount any other
horse. Many other circumstances, of a similar nature, occurred
respecting it; so that when it died, the king duly performed
its obsequies, and built around its tomb a city, which
he named after it.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar, the Dictator, it is said, had a horse, which would
allow no one to mount him but himself, and its forefeet
were like those of a man;<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a> indeed it is thus represented in
the statue before the temple of Venus. The late Emperor
Augustus also erected a tomb to his horse; on which occasion
Germanicus C&aelig;sar wrote a poem, which still exists. There
are at Agrigentum many tombs of horses, in the form of pyramids.
The Scythian horsemen make loud boasts of the fame
of their cavalry. On one occasion, one of their chiefs was
slain in single combat, and when the conqueror came to take
the spoils of the enemy, he was set upon by the horse of his
opponent, and trampled on and bitten to death.</p>
<p>Their docility, too, is so great, that we find it stated that
the whole of the cavalry of the Sybarite army were accustomed
to perform a kind of dance to the sound of musical
instruments. These animals also foresee battles; they lament
over their masters when they have lost them, and sometimes
shed tears<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> of regret for them. When King Nicomedes was
slain, his horse put an end to its life by fasting. Phylarchus
relates, that after Centaretus, the Galatian, had slain Antiochus
in battle he took possession of his horse, and mounted it
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
in triumph; upon which the animal, inflamed with indignation,
became quite ungovernable and threw himself headlong down
a precipice, so that they both perished together. Philistus
relates, that a horse of Dionysius once stuck fast in a morass,
but as soon as he disengaged himself, he followed the steps of
his master, with a swarm of bees, which had settled on his
mane; and that it was in consequence of this portent, that
Dionysius gained possession of the kingdom.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/i_p109.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="477" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">MUSTANG.</span></p>
</div>
<p>These animals possess an intelligence which exceeds all description.
Those who have to use the javelin are well aware
how the horse, by its
exertions and the supple
movements of its
body, aids the rider in
any difficulty he may
have in throwing his
weapon. They will
even present to their
master the weapons collected
on the ground.
The horses too, that
are yoked to the chariots
in the Circus, beyond a doubt display remarkable proofs
how sensible they are to encouragement and to glory. In
the Secular games, which were celebrated in the Circus,
under the Emperor Claudius, when the charioteer Corax,
who belonged to the white party,<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> was thrown from his place
at the starting-post, his horses took the lead and kept it,
opposing the other chariots, overturning them, and doing
everything against the other competitors that could have
been done, had they been guided by the most skilful charioteer;
and while we quite blushed to behold the skill of
man excelled by that of the horse, they arrived the winners at
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
the goal, after going over the whole of the prescribed course.
Our ancestors considered it as a still more remarkable portent,
that when a charioteer had been thrown from his place, in the
plebeian games of the Circus, the horses ran to the Capitol,
just as if he had been standing in the car, and went three
times round the temple there. But the greatest prodigy of
all, is the fact that the horses of Ratumenna came from Veii
to Rome, with the palm branch and chaplet, he himself having
fallen from his chariot, after having gained the victory; from
which circumstance the Ratumennian gate derived its name.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">ZEBRA.</span>&mdash;<i>&Aacute;sinus Zebra.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When the Sarmat&aelig;
are about to undertake
a long journey, they
prepare their horses for
it, by making them fast
the day before, during
which they give them
but little to drink; by
these means they are
enabled to travel on
horseback, without
stopping, for one hundred
and fifty miles.
Some horses are known to live fifty years. The poet Virgil
has very beautifully described the points which ought more
especially to be looked for, as constituting the perfection of a
horse; I myself have also treated of the same subject, in my
work on the Use of the Javelin by Cavalry, and I find that
pretty nearly all writers are agreed respecting them. The
points requisite for the Circus are somewhat different, however;
and while horses are put in training for other purposes
at only two years old, they are not admitted to the contests
of the Circus before their fifth year. We have an account of
a horse having lived to its seventy-fifth year. If a foal has
lost its mother, the other mares in the herd that have young,
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
will take charge of the orphan. The more spirited a horse is,
the deeper does it plunge its nose into the water while
drinking.</p>
<p>Gallicia and Asturia, countries of Spain, produce a species
of horse which have a peculiar pace of their own, very easy
for the rider, which arises from the two legs of the same side
being moved together. By studying the nature of this step
our horses have been taught the movement, which we call
ambling.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/i_p111.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="487" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">ASS.</span>&mdash;<i>&Aacute;sinus Vulg&aacute;ris.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Marcus Varro informs us that Quintus Axius, the senator,
paid for an ass the sum
of four hundred thousand
sesterces (or nearly
$16,000). I am not
sure whether this did
not exceed the price
ever given for any other
animal. It is certainly
a species of animal singularly
useful for ploughing,
and other farm
labor. The attachment
of asses to their young
is great in the extreme, but their aversion to water is still
greater. They will pass through fire to get at their foals,
while the very same animal, if the smallest stream intervenes,
will tremble, and not dare so much as to wet even its feet.
In their pastures they never drink at any but the usual watering-place,
and make it their care to find some dry path by
which to get at it. They will not pass over a bridge either,
when the water can be seen between the planks beneath.
Wonderful to relate, too, if their watering-places are changed,
though they should be ever so thirsty, they will not drink
without being either beaten or caressed. They ought always
to have plenty of room for sleeping; for they are subject to
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
various disturbances in their sleep, when they repeatedly
throw out their feet, and would immediately lame themselves
by coming in contact with any hard substance; so that it is
necessary that they should be provided with an empty space.
M&aelig;cenas was the first person who had the young of the ass
served up at his table;<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a> they were in those times much preferred
to the onager or wild ass; but, since his time, the
taste has gone out of fashion.</p>
<p>The best wild asses are those of Phrygia and Lycaonia.
Africa glories in the wild foals which she produces, as excelling
all others in the flavor of their flesh. It appears from some
Athenian records, that a mule once lived to the age of eighty
years. The people were greatly delighted with this animal,
because on one occasion, when, on the building of a temple in
the citadel (the Parthenon), it had been left behind on
account of its age, it persisted in promoting the work by accompanying
and assisting them; in consequence of which a
decree was passed, that the dealers in corn were not to drive
it away from their sieves.</p>
<h2 id="c43"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE OX.</h2>
<p>We find it stated, that the oxen of India are of the height
of camels, and that the extremities of their horns are four
feet apart. In our part of the world the most valuable oxen
are those of Epirus, owing, it is said, to the attention paid to
their breed by King Pyrrhus. He brought them to a very
large size, and descendants of this breed are to be seen at the
present day. The ox is the only animal that walks backwards
while it is feeding; among the Garamantes, they feed
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
in no other manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> Cattle that are bred in the Alps,
although very small of body, give a great quantity of milk,
and are capable of enduring much labor; they are yoked by
the horns, and not by the neck. The oxen of Syria have no
dewlap, but have a hump on the back. Those of Caria
in Asia, are unsightly in appearance, having a hump hanging
over the shoulders from the neck; and their horns
are movable; they are said, however, to be excellent workers,
though those which are either black or white are condemned
as worthless for labor. Oxen must be broken when
they are three years old; after that it is too late, and before
too early. The ox is most easily broken by yoking it with a
trained animal. The ox is our closest companion, both in
labor generally, and in the operations of agriculture. Our
ancestors considered it of so much value, that there is an
instance cited of a man being brought before the Roman
people, on a day appointed, and condemned, for having killed
an ox, in order to humor the whim of his wife, who said that
she had never tasted tripe; and he was driven into exile, just
as though he had killed one of his own peasants.</p>
<p>The bull has a proud air, a stern forehead, shaggy ears,
and horns which appear always ready, and challenging to the
combat; but it is by his fore feet that he manifests his threatening
anger. As his rage increases, he stands, lashing back
his tail every now and then, and throwing up the sand
against his belly; being the only animal that excites himself
by these means. We have seen them fight at the word of
command, and shown as a public spectacle; these bulls
whirled about and then fell upon their horns, and at once
were up again; then, at other times, they would lie upon the
ground and let themselves be lifted up; they would even
stand in a two-horsed chariot, while moving at a rapid rate,
like so many charioteers. The people of Thessaly invented
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
a method of killing bulls, by means of a man on horseback,
who would ride up to them, and seize one of the horns, and
so twist their neck. C&aelig;sar the Dictator was the first person
who exhibited this spectacle at Rome.</p>
<p>Bulls are selected as the very choicest of victims, and are
offered up as the most approved sacrifice for appeasing the
gods. Of all the animals that have long tails, this is the only
one whose tail is not of proportionate length at birth; and in
this animal alone it continues to grow until it reaches its
heels. It is on this account, that in making choice of a calf
for a victim, due care is taken that its tail reaches to the
pastern joint; if it is shorter than this, the sacrifice is not
deemed acceptable to the gods. This fact has also been
remarked, that calves, which have been carried to the altar
on men&rsquo;s shoulders, are not generally acceptable to the gods,
and also, if they are lame, or of a species which is not appropriate,
or if they struggle to get away from the altar. It was
a not uncommon prodigy among the ancients, for an ox to
speak; upon such a fact being announced to the senate, they
were in the habit of holding a meeting in the open air.</p>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE EGYPTIAN APIS.</h2>
<p>In Egypt an ox is even worshipped as a deity; they call it
Apis. It is distinguished by a conspicuous white spot on the
right side, in the form of a crescent. There is a knot also
under the tongue, which is called &ldquo;cantharus.&rdquo; This ox is
not allowed to live beyond a certain number of years; but is
then destroyed by being drowned in the fountain of the
priests. They then go, amid general mourning, and seek
another ox to replace it; and the mourning is continued, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
their heads shaved, until such time as they have found one; it
is not long, however, at any time, before they meet with a
successor. When one has been found, it is brought by the
priests to Memphis. There are two temples appropriated to
it, which are called thalami, and to these the people resort to
learn the auguries. According as the ox enters the one or
the other of these places, the augury is deemed favorable or
unfavorable. It gives answers to individuals, by taking food
from the hand of those who consult it. It turned away from
the hand of Germanicus C&aelig;sar, who died not long after. It
commonly lives in secret; but, when it comes forth in public,
the multitudes make way for it, and it is attended by a crowd
of boys, singing hymns in honor of it; it appears to be sensible
of the adoration thus paid to it, and to court it. These
crowds, too, suddenly become inspired, and predict future
events. There is a spot in the Nile, near Memphis, which,
from its figure, they call Phiala (the goblet); here they throw
into the water a dish of gold, and another of silver, every year
upon the days on which they celebrate the birth of Apis.
These days are seven in number, and it is a remarkable thing,
that during this time, no one is ever attacked by the crocodile;
on the eighth day, however, after the sixth hour, these
beasts resume all their former ferocity.</p>
<h2 id="c45"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />SHEEP AND THEIR WOOL.</h2>
<p>Many thanks do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing
the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece. As oxen
cultivate the fields which yield food for man, so to sheep are
we indebted for the defence of our bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>There are two principal kinds of sheep, the covered and
the colonic, or common sheep; the former is the more tender
animal, but the latter is more nice about its pastures, for
the covered sheep will feed even on brambles. The best
coverings for sheep are brought from Arabia.</p>
<p>The most esteemed wool of all is that of Apulia, and that
which in Italy is called Grecian wool, in other countries
Italian. The fleeces of Miletus hold the third rank. The
Apulian wool is shorter in the hair, and owes its high character
to the cloaks that are made of it. That which comes
from the vicinity of Tarentum and Canusium is the most celebrated;
and there is a wool from Laodicea, in Asia, of a
similar quality. There
is no white wool superior
to that of the countries
bordering on the
Padus, nor up to the
present day has any
wool exceeded the price
of one hundred sesterces
(or about $4.00)
per pound. The sheep
are not shorn in all
countries; in some places it is still the custom to pull off the
wool. There are so many various colors of wool, that we
lack terms to express them all. Pollentia, in the vicinity of
the Alps, produces black fleeces of the best quality; Asia,
the red fleeces; those of Canusium are of a tawny color; and
those of Tarentum have a peculiar dark tint. The wool of
Istria is much more like hair than wool, and is not suitable
for the fabrication of stuffs upon which a long nap is
required.</p>

<p>The thick, flocky wool has been esteemed for the manufacture
of carpets from the very earliest times; it is quite
clear, from what we read in Homer, that they were in use in
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
his time.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> Some kinds of wool are compressed for making
a felt, which, if soaked in vinegar,<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> is capable of resisting
iron even; and, what is still more, after having gone through
the last process, wool will even resist fire; the refuse, too,
when taken out of the vat of the scourer, is used for making
mattresses, an invention, I fancy, of the Gauls. At all
events, it is by Gallic names that we distinguish the various
sorts of mattresses at the present day; but I am not well able
to say at what period wool began to be employed for this
purpose. Our ancestors made use of straw for the purpose
of sleeping upon, just as they do at present when in camp.
The gausapa<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> has been brought into use in my fathers memory,
and I myself recollect the amphimalla<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> and the long
shaggy apron being introduced; but at the present day, the
laticlave tunic is beginning to be manufactured, in imitation
of the gausapa.<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> Black wool will take no color.</p>

<h2 id="c46"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLOTHS.</h2>
<p>Varro informs us, as an eye-witness, that in the temple of
Sancus, the wool was still preserved on the distaff and spindle
of Tanaquil,<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> who was also called Caia C&aelig;cilia; and he
says that the royal waved (or &ldquo;watered&rdquo;) toga, formerly
worn by Servius Tullius, and now in the temple of Fortune,
was made by her. Hence was derived the custom, on the
marriage of a young woman, of carrying in the procession a
dressed distaff and a spindle, with the thread arranged upon
it. Tanaquil was the first who wove the straight tunic, such
as our young people and newly-married women wear with the
white toga. Waved garments were at first the most esteemed
of all: after which those composed of various colors came
into vogue. Fenestella informs us, that togas with a smooth
surface, as well as the Phryxian togas of crisp and crinkly
wool, began to be used in the latter part of the reign of
Augustus. The pr&aelig;texta<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> had its origin among the Etrurians.
I find that the trabea<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> was first worn by the kings;
embroidered garments are mentioned by Homer,<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> and in this
class originated the triumphal robes. The Phrygians first
used the needle for this purpose, and hence this kind of garment
obtained the name of Phrygian. King Attalus, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
also lived in Asia, invented the art of embroidering with
gold, from which these garments have been called Attalic.
Babylon was very famous for making embroidery in different
colors, so that stuffs of this kind have obtained the name
of Babylonian. The method of weaving cloth with more
than two threads was invented at Alexandria; and in Gaul
cloths were first woven into checkered plaids. Metellus
Scipio, in the accusation which he brought against Cato,
stated that even in his time Babylonian covers for couches
were selling for eight hundred thousand sesterces, and these
of late, in the time of
the Emperor Nero, had
risen to four millions.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a>
The pr&aelig;text&aelig; of Servius
Tullius, with which
the statue of Fortune,
dedicated by him, was
covered, lasted until the
death of Sejanus; and
it is a remarkable fact
that, during a period of
five hundred and sixty
years, they had never
faded or received injury from moths. I myself have seen
the fleece upon the living animal dyed in strips of three
colors, purple, scarlet, and violet,&mdash;a pound and a-half of dye
being used for each,&mdash;just as though they had been produced by
Nature in this form, to meet the demands of
luxury.</p>

<p>In the sheep, it is considered a proof of its being of a very
fair breed, when the legs are short, and the belly is covered
with wool; when this part is bare, they are looked upon as
worthless. The tail of the Syrian sheep is a cubit in length,
and upon that part most of the wool is found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c47"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />GOATS.</h2>
<p>Some of these animals have no horns; but where there
are horns, the age of the animal is denoted by the number
of knots on them. In Cilicia, and in the vicinity of the
Syrtes, the inhabitants shear the goat for the purpose of
clothing themselves. It is said that the she goats in the
pastures will never look at each other at sun-set, but lie with
their backs towards one another, while at other times of the
day they lie facing each other and in family groups. They
all have long hair hanging down from the chin. If any one
of the flock is taken hold of and dragged by this hair, all the
rest gaze on in stupid astonishment.</p>
<p>Mutianus relates an instance of the intelligence of this
animal, of which he himself was an eye-witness. Two goats,
coming from opposite directions, met on a very narrow
bridge, which would not admit of either of them turning
round, and in consequence of its great length, they could not
safely go backwards, there being no sure footing on account
of its narrowness, while at the same time an impetuous torrent
was rapidly rushing beneath; accordingly, one of the
animals lay down flat, while the other walked over it.</p>

<br />THE NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES.</h2>
<h2 id="c48"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />WHY THE LARGEST ANIMALS ARE FOUND IN THE SEA.</h2>
<p>We have now given an account of the animals which we
call terrestrial, and which live as it were in a sort of society
with man. Among the remaining ones, it is well known that
the birds are the smallest; we shall therefore first describe
those which inhabit the seas, rivers, and standing waters.</p>
<p>Among these there are many to be found that exceed in
size any of the terrestrial animals; the evident cause of which
is the superabundance of moisture with which they are supplied.
Very different is the lot of the winged animals, whose
life is passed soaring aloft in the air. But in the seas, spread
out as they are far and wide, forming an element at once so
delicate and so vivifying, many animals are to be found of
monstrous form. Hence it is that the vulgar notion may
very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other
department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well;
while, at the same time, many other productions are there
to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be
found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals,
but of inanimate objects, is easy to be understood by all
who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the
sword-fish, the saw-fish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so
strongly resembles the real cucumber both in color and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
smell. We shall find the less reason then to be surprised to
find that in so small an object as a shell-fish the head of the
horse is to be seen protruding from the shell.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/i_p122.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="376" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">SEA-ELEPHANT.</span>&mdash;<i>Morunga proboscidea.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But the largest and most numerous of all these animals are
those found in the Indian seas; among which there are bal&aelig;n&aelig;,
four jugera in extent, and the pristis, two hundred cubits
long: here also are found cray-fish four cubits in length, and
in the river Ganges there are to be seen eels three hundred
feet long.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> But at sea, more especially about the time of the
solstices, these monsters are to be seen. For then in these
regions the whirlwinds blow, the rains descend, the hurricane
comes rushing down,
hurled from the mountain
heights, while the
sea is stirred up from
the very bottom, and
the monsters are driven
from their depths and
rolled upwards on the
crest of the billow.
Once upon a time the
fleet of Alexander the Great met with such vast multitudes
of tunnies, that he was able to make head against them only
by facing them in order of battle, just as he would have done
an enemy&rsquo;s fleet. Had the ships not done this, but proceeded
in a straggling manner, they could not possibly have made
their escape. No noises, no sounds, no blows had any effect
on these fish; by nothing short of the clash of battle were
they to be terrified, and by nothing less than their utter destruction
were they overpowered.</p>
<p>There is a large peninsula in the Red Sea, known by the
name of Cadara: as it projects into the deep it forms a vast
gulf, which it took the fleet of King Ptolemy twelve whole
days and nights to traverse by dint of rowing, for not a
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
breath of wind was to be perceived. In the recesses of this
becalmed spot more particularly, the sea-monsters attain so
vast a size that they are quite unable to move. The commanders
of the fleets of Alexander the Great have related
that the Gedrosi, who dwell upon the banks of the river Arabis,
are in the habit of making the doors of their houses<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a>
with the jaw-bones of fishes, and raftering the roofs with their
bones, many of which were found as much as forty cubits in
length. At this place, too, the sea-monsters, just like so
many cattle, were in the habit of coming on shore, and, after
feeding on the roots of shrubs, they would return; some of
them, which had the heads of horses, asses, and bulls, found
a pasture in the crops of grain.</p>
<p>The largest animals found in the Indian Sea are the pistrix
and the bal&aelig;na; while of the Gallic Ocean the physeter, or
blower, is the most bulky inhabitant, raising itself aloft like
some vast column, and, as it towers above the sails of ships,
belching forth, as it were, a deluge of water. In the ocean of
Gades there is a tree, with outspread branches so vast, that it
is supposed that it is for that reason it has never yet entered
the Straits. There are fish also found there which are called
sea-wheels, in consequence of their singular conformation;
they are divided by four spokes, the nave being guarded on
every side by a couple of eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c49"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE FORMS OF THE TRITONS AND NEREIDS.</h2>
<p>A deputation of persons from Olisipo (Lisbon) that had
been sent for the purpose, brought word to the Emperor
Tiberius that a triton<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> had been both seen and heard in a
certain cavern, blowing a conch-shell, and of the form under
which they are usually represented. Nor is the figure generally
attributed to the nereids at all a fiction; only in them,
the portion of the body that resembles the human figure is
still rough all over with scales. For one of these creatures
was seen upon the same shores, and as it died, its plaintive
murmurs were heard by the inhabitants at a distance. The
legatus of Gaul, too, wrote word to the late Emperor Augustus
that a considerable number of nereids had been found
dead upon the sea-shore. I have, too, some distinguished
informants of equestrian rank, who state that they themselves
once saw in the ocean of Gades a sea-man, which bore in
every part of his body a perfect resemblance to a human
being, and that during the night he would climb up into
ships; upon which the side of the vessel where he seated
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
himself would instantly sink downward, and if he remained
there any considerable time, even go under water.</p>
<p>In the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, a subsidence of the
ocean left exposed on the shores of an island which faces the
province of Lugdunum as many as three hundred animals or
more, all at once, quite marvellous for their varied shapes
and enormous size, and no less a number upon the shores of
the Santones; among the rest there were elephants and rams,
which last, however, had only a white spot to represent horns.
Turranius has also left accounts of several nereids, and he
speaks of a monster that was thrown up on the shore at
Gades, the distance between the two fins at the end of the
tail of which was sixteen cubits, and its teeth one hundred
and twenty in number; the largest being nine, and the smallest
six inches in length.</p>
<p>Marcus Scaurus, in his &aelig;dileship, exhibited at Rome,
among other wonderful things, the bones of the monster to
which Andromeda was said to have been exposed, and which
he had brought from Joppa, a city of Jud&aelig;a. These bones
exceeded forty feet in length, and the ribs were higher than
those of the Indian elephant, while the back-bone was a foot
and a-half in thickness.</p>
<h2 id="c50"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE BAL&AElig;NA AND THE ORCA.</h2>
<p>The bal&aelig;na penetrates even to our seas. It is said that
they are not to be seen in the ocean of Gades before the winter
solstice, and that at periodical seasons they retire and conceal
themselves in some calm capacious bay. This fact, however,
is known to the orca, an animal which is peculiarly hostile
to the bal&aelig;na, and the form of which cannot be in any
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
way adequately described, but as an enormous mass of flesh
armed with teeth. This animal attacks the bal&aelig;na with its
young, in its places of retirement, and as they turn to defend
themselves, it pierces them just as though they had been
attacked by the beak
of a Liburnian galley.
The bal&aelig;n&aelig;, devoid of
all flexibility, without
energy to defend themselves,
are well aware
that their only resource
is to take to flight in
the open sea and to
range over the whole
face of the ocean; while the orc&aelig;, on the other hand, do all
in their power to meet them in their flight, throw themselves
in their way, and either kill them cooped up in a narrow passage,
or else drive them on a shoal, or dash them to pieces
against the rocks. When these battles are witnessed, it appears
just as though
the sea were infuriated
against itself; not a
breath of wind may be
felt in the bay, and yet
the waves by their pantings
and their repeated
blows will be heaved
aloft in a way which no
whirlwind could effect.</p>

</div>
<p>An orca has been
seen even in the port
of Ostia, where it was
attacked by the Emperor Claudius. While he was constructing
the harbor there, an orca came, attracted by some
hides brought from Gaul, which had happened to fall overboard
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
there. Feeding upon these for several days it had quite
glutted itself, and hollowed out a channel in the shoal water.
Here, the sand was thrown up by the action of the wind to
such an extent, that the creature found it quite impossible to
turn round; and while in the act of pursuing its prey, it was
propelled by the waves towards the shore, so that its back
came to be perceived above the level of the water, very much
resembling in appearance the keel of a vessel turned bottom
upwards. Upon this, C&aelig;sar ordered a great number of nets
to be extended across the mouth of the harbor, from shore to
shore, while he himself went there with the pr&aelig;torian cohorts,
affording a spectacle to the Roman people; for boats
assailed the monster, while the soldiers on board showered
lances upon it. I myself saw one of the boats sunk by the
water which the animal, as it respired, showered down upon
it.</p>
<h2 id="c51"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />DOLPHINS.</h2>
<p>The swiftest not only of the sea-animals, but of all animals
whatever, is the dolphin.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> He is more rapid in his movements
than a bird, more swift than the flight of an arrow, and
were it not for the fact that his mouth is much below his
muzzle, almost, indeed, in the middle of the belly, not a fish
would be able to escape his pursuit. But Nature, in her
prudence, has thrown certain impediments in his way; for,
unless he turns and throws himself on his back, he can seize
nothing, and it is this circumstance more especially that gives
proof of his extraordinary swiftness. For, if pressed by hunger,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
he will follow a fish, as it flies down, to the very bottom
of the water, and then after holding his breath thus long, will
dart again to the surface to breathe, with the speed of an
arrow discharged from a bow; and often, on such occasions,
he is known to leap out of the water with such a bound, as to
fly right over the sails of a ship.</p>
<p>Dolphins generally go in couples. They suckle their young
like the bal&aelig;na, and even carry them during the weakness of
infancy; in addition to which, they accompany them long
after they are grown up, so great is their affection for their
progeny. The young ones grow very speedily, and in ten
years arrive at their full size. The dolphin lives thirty years;
a fact that has been ascertained from cutting marks on the
tail, by way of experiment. It conceals itself for thirty days,
at about the rising of the Dog-star, so effectually, that it is
not known whither it goes; a thing the more surprising as it
is unable to breathe under water. Dolphins are in the habit
of darting upon the shore, for some unknown reason. The
tongue, contrary to the nature of aquatic animals in general,
is movable, being short and broad, not much unlike that of
the pig. Instead of a voice, they emit a moaning sound similar
to that made by a human being; the back is arched, and
the nose turned up. For this reason they all recognize in a
most surprising manner the name of Simo, and prefer to be
called by that rather than by any other.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
<p>The dolphin is an animal not only friendly to man, but a
lover of music as well; he is charmed by melodious concerts,
especially by the notes of the water-organ. He does not
dread man, as though a stranger to him, but comes to meet
ships, leaps and bounds to and fro, vies with them in swiftness,
and passes them when in full sail.</p>
<p>In the reign of the late Emperor Augustus, a dolphin
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
which had been carried to the Lucrine Lake conceived a
most wonderful affection for the child of a certain poor man,
who was in the habit of going that way from Bai&aelig; to Puteoli
to school, and who used to stop there in the middle of the
day, call him by his name of Simo, and would often entice
him to the banks of the lake with pieces of bread which he
carried for the purpose. I should really have felt ashamed to
mention this, had not the incident been stated in writing in
the works of M&aelig;cenas, Fabianus, Flavius Alfius, and many
others. At whatever hour of the day he might happen to be
called by the boy, and although hidden and out of sight at
the bottom of the water, he would instantly fly to the surface,
and after feeding from his hand, would present his back for
him to mount, taking care to conceal the spiny projection of
his fins in their sheath, as it were; and so, sportively taking
him up on his back, he would carry him over a wide expanse of
sea to the school at Puteoli, and in a similar manner bring
him back again. This happened for several years, until at
last the boy happened to fall ill of some malady, and died.
The dolphin came again and again to the spot as usual, with
a sorrowful air and manifesting every sign of deep affliction,
until at last (a thing of which no one felt the slightest
doubt), he died purely of sorrow and regret.</p>
<p>Within a few years another dolphin at Hippo Diarrhytus,
on the coast of Africa, in a similar manner used to receive his
food from the hands of various persons, present himself for
their caresses, sport about among the swimmers, and carry
them on his back. On being rubbed with unguents by Flavianus,
the proconsul of Africa, he was lulled to sleep, as it
appeared, by the sensation of an odor so new to him, and
floated about just as though he had been dead. For some
months after this, he carefully avoided all intercourse with
man, as though he had received some affront or other; but at
the end of that time he returned, and afforded the same wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
scenes as before. At last, the vexations that were
caused them by having to entertain so many influential men
who came to see this sight, compelled the people of Hippo to
put the animal to death.</p>
<p>Before this, there was a similar story told of a child at the
city of Iasus, for whom a dolphin was long observed to have
conceived a most ardent affection, until one day the animal
eagerly following him as he was making for the shore, was
carried by the tide on the sands, and there expired. Alexander
the Great appointed this boy high-priest of Neptune at
Babylon, interpreting this extraordinary attachment as a convincing
proof of the favor of that divinity.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/i_p130.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="244" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">DOLPHIN.</span>&mdash;<i>Delphinus Delphis.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Hegesidemus informs us, that in the same city of Iasus
there was a boy, Hermias
by name, who in
a similar manner used
to traverse the sea on
a dolphin&rsquo;s back, but
that on one occasion a
tempest suddenly arising,
he lost his life, and was brought back dead; upon which
the dolphin, who thus admitted that he had been the cause
of his death, would not return to the sea, but lay down upon
the dry land, and there expired.</p>
<p>Theophrastus tells us, that the very same thing happened
at Naupactus; nor, in fact, is there any limit to similar
instances. The Amphilochians and the Tarentines have similar
stories about children and dolphins; and all these give
an air of credibility to the one that is told of Arion, the
famous performer on the lyre. The mariners being on the
point of throwing him into the sea, for the purpose of taking
possession of the money he had earned, he prevailed upon
them to allow him one more song, accompanied with the
music of his lyre. The melody attracted numbers of dolphins
around the ship, and, upon throwing himself into the sea, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
was taken up by one of them, and borne in safety to the
shore of the Promontory of T&aelig;narum.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a></p>
<p>There is in the province of Gallia Narbonensis and in the
territory of Nemausus a lake known by the name of Latera,
where dolphins fish in company with men. At the narrow
outlet of this lake, at stated seasons of the year innumerable
multitudes of mullets make their way into the sea, taking
advantage of the turn of the tide; hence it is quite impossible
to employ nets sufficiently strong to bear so vast a weight,
even though the fish had not the instinctive shrewdness to
watch their opportunity. By a similar instinct the fish immediately
make with all speed towards the deep water which is
found in a gulf in that vicinity, and hasten to escape from the
only spot that is at all convenient for spreading the nets.
As soon as the fishermen perceive this, all the people&mdash;for
great multitudes resort thither, being well aware of the
proper time, and especially desirous of sharing in the amusement&mdash;shout
as loud as they can, and summon Simo to the
scene of action. The dolphins very quickly understand that
they are in requisition, as a north-east wind speedily carries
the sound to their retreats, though a south one would somewhat
retard it by carrying it in an opposite direction. Even
then however, sooner than you could have possibly supposed,
there are the dolphins, in all readiness to assist. They are
seen approaching in haste in battle array, and, immediately
taking up their position when the engagement is about to
take place, they cut off all escape to the open sea, and drive
the terrified fish into shallow water. The fishermen then
throw their nets, holding them up at the sides with forks,
though the mullets with inconceivable agility instantly leap
over them; while the dolphins, on the other hand, are waiting
in readiness to receive them, and content themselves for the
present with killing them only, postponing all thoughts of
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
eating till after they have secured the victory. The battle
waxes hot apace, and the dolphins, pressing on with the
greatest vigor, readily allow themselves to be enclosed in the
nets; but in order that the fact of their being thus enclosed
may not urge the enemy to find additional means of flight,
they glide along so stealthily among the boats and nets, or
else the swimmers, as not to leave them any opening for
escape. Not one among them attempts to make its escape
by leaping, which at other times is their favorite amusement,
except when the nets are purposely lowered for it; and even
after it has come out it continues the battle, as it were, up to
the very ramparts. At last, when the capture is now completed,
they devour those among the fish which they have
killed; but being well aware that they have given too active
an assistance to be repaid with only one day&rsquo;s reward, they
take care to wait there till the following day, when they are
filled not only with fish, but bread crumbs soaked in wine.</p>
<p>The account which Mucianus gives of a similar mode of
fishing in the Iasian Gulf differs from the preceding one, in
the fact that there the dolphins make their appearance of
their own accord, and do not require to be called; they
receive their share from the hands of the people, each boat
having its own particular associate among the dolphins; and
this, although the fishing is carried on at night-time by the
light of torches.</p>
<p>Dolphins, also, form among themselves a sort of general
community. Once, when one of them had been captured by
a king of Caria and chained up in the harbor, great multitudes
of dolphins assembled at the spot, and with signs of
sorrow which could not be misunderstood, appealed to the
sympathies of the people, until at last the king ordered it to
be released. The young dolphins are always attended by a
larger one, who acts as a guardian to them; and before now,
they have been seen carrying off the body of one which had
died, that it might not be devoured by the sea-monsters.</p>

<br />THE VARIOUS KINDS OF TURTLES.</h2>
<p>The Indian Sea produces turtles of such vast size, that
with the shell of a single animal they are able to roof a habitable
cottage; and among the islands of the Red Sea, the navigation
is mostly carried on in boats formed of these shells.
They are to be caught in many ways; but they are generally
taken when they have come up to the surface of the water
just before midday, a season at which they experience great
delight in floating on the calm surface, with the back entirely
out of the water. Here the delightful sensations which
attend a free respiration beguile them to such a degree, and
render them so utterly regardless of their safety, that their
shell becomes so dried up by the heat of the sun,
that they are unable to descend, and, having to float
against their will, become an easy prey to the fishermen. It
is said also, that they leave the water at night for the purpose
of feeding, and eat with such avidity as to glut themselves: upon
which, they become weary, and on their return
in the morning, to the sea, they fall asleep on the surface of
the water. The noise of their snoring betrays them, upon
which the fishermen stealthily swim towards the animals,
three to each turtle; two of them, in a moment, throw it on
its back, while a third slings a noose around it, as it lies face
upwards, and then more men who are ready on shore, draw it
to land.</p>
<p>In the Ph&oelig;nician Sea they are taken without the slightest
difficulty, and, at stated periods of the year, come of their
own accord to the river Eleutherus, in immense numbers.
The turtle has no teeth, but the edge of the mouth is sharp,
the upper part shutting down over the lower like the lid of a
box. In the sea it lives upon shell-fish, and such is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
strength of its jaws, that it is able to break stones; when on
shore, it feeds upon herbage. The female turtle lays eggs
like those of birds, one hundred in number; these she buries
on the dry land, covers them over with earth, pats it down
with her breast, and sits on them during the night. The
young are hatched in the course of a year. Some persons
are of opinion that they hatch their eggs by means of the
eyes, by merely looking at them. The Troglodyt&aelig; have turtles
with horns,<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> which resemble the branches of a lyre; they
are large, but movable, and assist the animal like so many
oars while swimming. The name of this fine but rarely-found
turtle, is &ldquo;chelyon;&rdquo; for the rocks, from the sharpness of
their points, frighten away the Chelonophagi, while the
Troglodyt&aelig;, whose shores these animals frequent, worship
them as sacred. There are some land turtles the shells of
which are used for the purposes of art. They are found in
the deserts of Africa, in the parts where the scorched sands
are more especially destitute of water, and subsist, it is
believed, upon the moisture of the dews. No other animal is
to be found there.</p>
<p>Carvilius Pollio, a man of prodigal habits and ingenious in
inventing the refinements of luxury, was the first to cut the
shell of the tortoise into lamin&aelig;, or thin slices, and to veneer
beds and cabinets with it.</p>
<h2 id="c53"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />DISTRIBUTION OF AQUATIC ANIMALS INTO VARIOUS SPECIES.</h2>
<p>The integuments of the aquatic animals are many in number.
Some are covered with a hide and hair, as the sea-calf
and hippopotamus, for instance; others again, with a hide
only, as the dolphin; others again, with a shell, as the turtle;
others, with a coat as hard as a stone, like the oyster and
other shell-fish; others, with a crust, such as the cray-fish;
others, with a crust and spines, like the sea-urchin; others,
with scales, as fishes in general; others, with a rough
skin, as the squatina, the skin of which is used for polishing
wood and ivory; others, with a soft skin, like the mur&aelig;na;
and others with none at all, like the polypus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/i_p135.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="763" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">GROUP OF SEALS.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Of all aquatic animals the sea-calf is killed with the greatest
difficulty, unless the head is cut off at once. It makes a
noise which sounds like lowing, whence the name of &ldquo;sea-calf.&rdquo;
The animals are susceptible, however, of training, and
with their voice, as well as by gestures, can be taught to salute
the public; when called by their name, they answer with a discordant
kind of grunt.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a> No animal has a deeper sleep than
this; on dry land it creeps along as though on feet, by the
aid of what it uses as fins when in the sea. Its skin, even
when separated from the body, is said to retain a certain sensitive
sympathy with the sea, and at the reflux of the tide, the
hair on it always rises upright: in addition to which, it is said
that there is in the right fin a certain soporiferous influence,
and that, if placed under the head, it induces sleep.</p>
<p>There are one hundred and seventy-four species of fishes,
exclusive of the crustacea, of which there are thirty kinds.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
<p>Tunnies are among the most remarkable for their size; we
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
have found one weighing as much as fifteen talents (1200
pounds), the breadth of its tail being five cubits and a palm.
In some of the rivers, also, there are fish of no less size, such,
for instance, as the silurus of the Nile, the isox of the Rhine,
and the attilus of the Po, which, naturally of an inactive
nature, sometimes grows so fat as to weigh a thousand
pounds, and when taken with a hook, attached to a chain,
requires a yoke of oxen to draw it on land. An extremely
small fish, which is known as the clupea, attaches itself, with
a wonderful tenacity, to a certain vein in the throat of the
attilus, and destroys it by its bite. The silurus carries devastation
with it wherever it goes, attacks every living creature,
and often drags beneath the water horses as they swim. It is
also remarkable, that in the river Main of Germany, a fish
that bears a very strong resemblance to the sea-pig, requires
to be drawn out of the water by a yoke of oxen; and in the
Danube, it is taken with large hooks of iron. In the Borysthenes,
also, there is said to be a fish of enormous size, the
flesh of which has no bones or spines in it, and is remarkable
for its sweetness.</p>
<p>In the Ganges, a river of India, there is a fish found which
they call the platanista; it has the muzzle and the tail of the
dolphin, and measures sixteen cubits in length. Statius
Sebosus says, a thing that is marvellous in no small degree,
that in the same river there are fishes found, called worms;
these have two gills, and are sixty cubits in length; they are
of an azure color, and have received their name from their
peculiar conformation. These fish, he says, are of such enormous
strength, that with their teeth they seize hold of the
trunks of elephants that come to drink, and so drag them
into the water.</p>
<p>The Black Sea is never entered by any animal that is noxious
to fish, with the exception of the sea-calf and the small
dolphin. On entering, the tunnies range along the shores to
the right, and on departing, keep to those on the left; this is
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
supposed to arise from the fact that they have better sight
with the right eye, their powers of vision with either being
naturally very limited. In the channel of the Thracian Bosporus,
by which the Propontis is connected with the Black
Sea, at the narrowest part of the Straits which separate
Europe from Asia, there is, near Chalcedon, on the Asiatic
side, a rock of remarkable whiteness, the whole of which can
be seen from the bottom of the sea. Alarmed at the sudden
appearance of this rock, the tunnies always hasten in great
numbers, and with headlong impetuosity, towards the promontory
of Byzantium, which stands exactly opposite to it, and
from this circumstance has received the name of the Golden
Horn.<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a> Hence it is, that all the fishing is at Byzantium, to
the great loss of Chalcedon, although it is only separated
from it by a channel a mile in width. They wait, however,
for the blowing of the north wind to leave the Black Sea with
a favorable tide, and are never taken until they have entered
the harbor of Byzantium. These fish do not move about in
winter; in whatever place they may happen to be surprised
by it, there they pass the winter, till the time of the equinox.</p>
<p>Manifesting a wonderful degree of delight, they will often
accompany a vessel in full sail, and may be seen from the
deck following it for hours, over a distance of several miles.
If a fish-spear is thrown at them never so many times, they are
not in the slightest degree alarmed at it. Some writers call
the tunnies which follow ships in this manner, by the name of
pompili, or pilot-fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c54"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />FISHES VALUED FOR THE TABLE.</h2>
<p>At the present day, the first place in point of delicacy is
given to the scarus, the only fish that is said to ruminate, and
to feed on grass and not on other fish. It is mostly found in
the Carpathian Sea, and never of its own accord passes Lectum,
a promontory of Troas. Optatus Elipertius, the commander
of the fleet under the Emperor Claudius, had this fish
brought from that locality, and dispersed in various places off
the coast between Ostia and the districts of Campania.
During five years, the greatest care was taken that those
which were caught should be returned to the sea; but since
then they have been always found in great abundance off the
shores of Italy, where formerly there were none to be taken.
Thus has gluttony introduced these fish, to be a dainty within
its reach, and added a new inhabitant to the seas; so that we
ought to feel no surprise that foreign birds breed at Rome.</p>
<p>The fish that is next in estimation for the table is the mustela,
but that is valued only for its liver. A singular thing to
tell of&mdash;the lake of Brigantia (the modern Lake Constance),
in Rh&aelig;tia, lying in the midst of the Alps, produces them to
rival even those of the sea.</p>
<p>Of the remaining fish that are held in any degree of esteem,
the mullet is the most highly valued, as well as the most
abundant of all; it is of only a moderate size, rarely exceeds
two pounds in weight, and will never grow beyond that
weight in preserves or fish-ponds. These fish are only to be
found in the Northern Ocean, exceeding two pounds in
weight, and even there in none but the more westerly parts.
As for the other kinds, the various species are numerous;
some live upon sea-weed, while others feed on the oyster,
slime, and the flesh of other fish. The more distinctive mark
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
is a forked beard, that projects beneath the lower lip. The
lautarius, or mud-mullet, is held in the lowest esteem of all.
This last is always accompanied by another fish, known as the
sargus, and where the mullet stirs up the mud, the other finds
aliment for its own sustenance. The mullet most esteemed
of all has a strong flavor of shell-fish. The masters in gastronomy
inform us, that the mullet, while dying, assumes a
variety of colors and a succession of shades, and that the hue
of the red scales, growing paler and paler, gradually changes,
more especially if it is looked at enclosed in glass.<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a> Marcus
Apicus, a man who displayed a remarkable degree of ingenuity
in everything relating to luxury, was of opinion, that it
was a most excellent plan to let the mullet die in the pickle
known as the &ldquo;garum of the allies&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a>&mdash;for we find that even
this has found a surname&mdash;and he proposed a prize for any
one who should invent a new sauce, made from the liver of
this fish. I find it much easier to relate this fact, than to
state who it was that gained the prize.</p>
<p>Asinius Celer, a man of consular rank, and remarkable for
his prodigal expenditure on this fish, bought one at Rome,
during the reign of the Emperor Caligula, at the price of eight
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
thousand sesterces.<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> A reflection upon such a fact as this
will at once lead us to turn our thoughts to those who, making
loud complaints against luxury, have lamented that a single
cook cost more money to buy than a horse; while at the present
day a cook is only to be obtained for the same sum that a
triumph would cost, and a fish is only to be purchased at what
was formerly the price
for a cook! indeed,
there is hardly any living
being held in higher
esteem than the man
who understands how,
in the most scientific
fashion, to get rid of
his master&rsquo;s property.</p>

</div>
<p>Licinius Mucianus
relates, that in the Red
Sea there was caught
a mullet eighty pounds
in weight. What a
price would have been
paid for it by our epicures,
if it had only
been found off the
shores in the vicinity
of our city!</p>
<p>Eels live eight years; they are able to survive out of
water as much as six days, when a north-east wind blows; but
when the south wind prevails, not so many. In winter, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
cannot live if they are in very shallow water, or if the water is
troubled. They are taken about the rising of the Pleiades
when the rivers are turbid. These animals seek their food
at night; they are the only fish the bodies of which, when
dead, do not float upon the surface.</p>
<p>There is a lake called Benacus, in the territory of Verona,
in Italy, through which the river Mincius flows. At the part
of it whence this river issues, once a year, and mostly in the
month of October, the lake is troubled, evidently by the constellations
of autumn, and the eels are heaped together by the
waves, and rolled on by them in such astonishing multitudes,
that single masses of them, containing more than a thousand
in number, are often taken in the chambers which are formed
in the bed of the river for that purpose.</p>
<h2 id="c55"><span class="large">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />PECULIAR FISHES.</h2>
<p>In Northern Gaul the fish called mur&aelig;na has on the right
jaw seven spots, which bear a resemblance to the constellation
of the Great Dipper, and are of a gold color, shining as long
as the animal is alive, but disappearing as soon as it is dead.
Vedius Pollio, a Roman of equestrian rank, and one of the
friends of the late Emperor Augustus, found a method of exercising
his cruelty by means of this animal, for he caused
such slaves as had been condemned by him, to be thrown into
preserves filled with mur&aelig;n&aelig;; not that the land animals
would not have fully sufficed for this purpose, but because he
could not see a man so aptly torn to pieces all at once by any
other kind of animal. It is said that these fish are driven to
madness by the taste of vinegar. Their skin is exceedingly
thin; while that of the eel, on the other hand, is much thicker.
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
Verrius informs us that formerly the children of the Roman
citizens, while wearing the pr&aelig;texta, were flogged with eel-skins.</p>
<p>There is a very small fish that is in the habit of living
among the rocks, and is known as the
echeneis.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a> It is believed
that when this has attached itself to the keel of a
ship its progress is impeded, and from this circumstance it
takes its name.</p>
<p>Mucianus speaks of a murex of larger size than the purple
murex with a head that is neither rough nor round; and the
shell of which is single, and falls in folds on either side. He
tells us, also, that some
of these creatures once
attached themselves to
a ship freighted with
children of noble birth,
and that they stopped
its course in full sail.
Trebius Niger says
that this fish is a foot
in length, and that it
can retard the course of vessels, five fingers in thickness;
besides which, it has another peculiar property&mdash;when preserved
in salt, and applied, it is able to draw up gold which
has fallen into a well, however deep it may happen to be.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">

</div>
<p>The only fish that builds itself a nest is the phycis: it
makes it of sea-weed, and there deposits its eggs, which it
defends from the attacks of enemies.</p>
<p>The sea-swallow, being able to fly, bears a strong resemblance
to the bird of that name; the sea-kite, too, flies as
well.</p>
<p>There is a fish that comes up to the surface of the sea,
known, from the following circumstance, as the lantern-fish:
thrusting from its mouth a tongue that shines like fire, it
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
emits a most brilliant light on calm nights. Another fish,
which, from its horns, has received its name, raises them
nearly a foot and a-half above the surface of the water. The
sea-dragon, again, if caught and thrown on the sand, works
out a hole for itself with its muzzle, with the most wonderful
celerity.</p>
<h2 id="c56"><span class="large">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />BLOODLESS FISHES.</h2>
<p>The varieties of fish which we shall now mention are those
which have no blood: they are of three kinds&mdash;first, those
which are known as &ldquo;soft;&rdquo; next, those which have thin
crusts; and, lastly, those which are enclosed in hard shells.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a>
The soft fish are the loligo, the s&aelig;pia, the polypus, and others
of a similar nature. The last have the head between the feet
and the belly, and all of them have eight feet: in the s&aelig;pia
and the loligo two of these feet are very long and rough, and
by means of these they lift the food to their mouths, and
attach themselves to places in the sea, as though with an
anchor; the others act as so many arms, by means of which
they seize their prey.</p>
<p>The loligo is also able to dart above the surface of the
water, and the scallop does the same, like an arrow as it were.
In the s&aelig;pia, the male is parti-colored, blacker than the
female, and more courageous. If the female is struck with a
fish-spear, the male comes to her aid; but the female, the
instant the male is struck, takes to flight. Both of them, as
soon as they find themselves in danger of being caught, discharge
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
a kind of ink, and thus darkening the water, take to
flight.</p>
<p>There are numerous kinds of polypi. The land polypus is
larger than that of the sea; they all of them use their arms
as feet and hands. The polypus has a sort of passage in the
back, by which it lets in and discharges the water, and which
it shifts from side to side, sometimes carrying it on the right,
and sometimes on the left. It swims obliquely, with the head
on one side, which is of surprising hardness while the animal
is alive, being puffed out with air. In addition to this, they
have cavities dispersed throughout the claws, by means of
which, through suction, they can adhere to objects, with the
head upwards, so tightly, that they cannot be torn away.
They cannot attach themselves, however, to the bottom of
the sea, and their retentive powers are weaker in the larger
ones. These are the only soft fish that come on dry land,
and then only where the surface is rugged: a smooth surface
they will not come near. They feed upon the flesh of shellfish,
the shells of which they can easily break in the embrace
of their arms: their retreat may be easily detected by the
pieces of shell which lie before it. Although, in other respects,
this is looked upon as a remarkably stupid kind of
animal, so much so, that it will swim towards the hand of a
man, in its own domestic matters it manifests considerable
intelligence. It carries its prey to its home, and after eating
all the flesh, throws out the debris, and then pursues such
small fish as may chance to swim towards them. It also
changes its color, according to the aspect of the place where
it is, and more especially when it is alarmed. The notion is
entirely unfounded that it gnaws its own arms; this mischance
befalls it from the congers; but it is perfectly true
that its arms shoot forth again, like the tail in the colotus and
the lizard.</p>
<p>Among the most remarkable curiosities among all the
inhabitants of the sea is the animal which has the name of
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
nautilus, or, as some people call it, the pompilos. Lying
with the head upwards, it rises to the surface of the water,
raising itself little by little, while, by means of a certain conduit
in its body, it discharges all the water, and this being got
rid of like so much bilge-water as it were, it finds no difficulty
in sailing along the surface. Then, extending backwards its
two front arms, it stretches out between them a membrane of
marvellous thinness, which acts as a sail spread out to the
wind, while with the rest of its arms it paddles along below,
steering itself with its tail in the middle, which acts as a rudder.
Thus does it make its way along the deep, mimicking
the appearance of a light Liburnian bark; while, if anything
chances to cause it alarm, in an instant it draws in the water,
and sinks out of sight.</p>
<p>Belonging to the genus of polypi is the animal known as
the oz&aelig;na, being so called from the peculiarly strong smell
exhaled by the head; in consequence of which, the mur&aelig;n&aelig;
pursue it with the greatest eagerness. The polypi keep themselves
concealed for two months in the year; they do not live
beyond two years, and always die of consumption. I must
not omit here the observations which Lucullus, the proconsul
of B&aelig;tica, made with reference to the polypus, and which Trebius
Niger, one of his suite, has published. He says that it
is remarkably fond of shell-fish, and that these, the moment
that they feel themselves touched by it, close their valves,
and cut off the feelers of the polypus, thus making a meal
at the expense of the plunderer. Shell-fish are destitute of
sight, as well as of all other sensations but those which warn
them of hunger and the approach of danger. Hence the
polypus lies in ambush till the fish opens its shell, immediately
upon which, it places within it a small pebble, taking
care, at the same time, to keep it from touching the body of
the animal, lest, by making some movement, it should chance
to eject it. Having made itself thus secure, it attacks its
prey, and draws out the flesh, while the other tries to contract
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
itself, but all in vain, in consequence of the separation
of the shell, thus effected by the insertion of the wedge. So
great is the instinctive shrewdness in animals that are otherwise
quite remarkable for their lumpish stupidity.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the same author states, that no
animal in existence is more dangerous for its powers of destroying
a human being when in the water. Embracing his
body, it counteracts his struggles, and draws him under with
its feelers and its numerous suckers, when, as often is the
case, it happens to make an attack upon a shipwrecked mariner
or a child. If, however, the animal is turned over, it
loses all its power; for when it is thrown upon the back, the
arms open of themselves.</p>
<p>The other particulars, which the same author has given,
appear still more closely to border upon the marvellous. At
Carteia, in the preserves there, a polypus was in the habit of
coming from the sea to the pickling-tubs that were left open,
and devouring the fish laid in the salt&mdash;for it is quite astonishing
how eagerly all sea-animals follow the smell of salted
condiments, so that for this reason the fishermen take care
to rub the inside of the wicker fish-kipes with them.&mdash;At last,
by its repeated thefts and immoderate depredations, it drew
down upon itself the wrath of the keepers of the works. Palisades
were placed before them, but these the polypus managed
to get over by the aid of a tree, and it was only caught at last
by calling in the assistance of trained dogs, which surrounded
it at night, as it was returning to its prey; upon which, the
keepers, awakened by the noise, were struck with alarm at
the novelty of the sight presented. First of all, the size of
the polypus was enormous beyond all conception; then it
was covered all over with dried brine, and exhaled a most
dreadful stench. Who could have expected to find a polypus
there, or could have recognized it as such under these circumstances?
They really thought that they were joining battle
with some monster, for at one instant, it would drive off the
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
dogs by its horrible fumes, and lash at them with the extremities
of its feelers; while at another, it would strike them
with its stronger arms, giving blows with so many clubs, as
it were; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that it
could be despatched with the aid of a considerable number
of three-pronged fish-spears. The head of this animal was
shown to Lucullus; it was in size as large as a cask of fifteen
amphor&aelig;, and had a beard, to use the expressions of Trebius
himself, which could hardly be encircled with both arms, full
of knots, like those upon a club, and thirty feet in length;
the suckers or calicules, as large as an urn, resembled a basin
in shape, while the teeth again were of a corresponding largeness:
its remains, which were carefully preserved as a curiosity,
weighed seven hundred pounds. The same author also
informs us, that specimens of the s&aelig;pia and the loligo have
been thrown up on the same shores of a size fully as large:
in our own seas the loligo is sometimes found five cubits in
length, and the s&aelig;pia, two. These animals do not live beyond
two years.</p>
<p>Mucianus relates that he has seen, in the Propontis, another
curious resemblance to a ship in full sail. There is a
shell-fish, he says, with a keel, just like that of the vessel
which we know by the name of acatium, with the stern curving
inwards, and a prow with the beak attached. In this
shell-fish there lies concealed also an animal known as the
nauplius, which bears a strong resemblance to the s&aelig;pia, and
only adopts the shell-fish as the companion of its pastimes.
There are two modes, he says, which it adopts in sailing;
when the sea is calm, the voyager hangs down its arms, and
strikes the water as with a pair of oars; but if the wind invites,
it extends them, employing them by way of a helm,
and turning the mouth of the shell to the wind. The pleasure
experienced by the shell-fish is that of carrying the other,
while the amusement of the nauplius consists in steering;
and thus, at the same moment, is an instinctive joy felt by
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
these two creatures, devoid as they are of all sense, unless, a
natural antipathy to man&mdash;for it is a well-known fact, that to
see them thus sailing along, is a bad omen, and that it is portentous
of misfortune to those who witness it.<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
<p>The cray-fish, which belongs to the class of bloodless animals,
is protected by a brittle crust. This creature, like the
crab, keeps itself concealed for five months. But at the
beginning of spring both of them, after the manner of snakes,
throw off old age, and renew their coverings. While other
animals swim on the water, cray-fish float with a kind of
action like creeping. They move onwards, if there were
nothing to alarm them, in a straight line, extending on each
side their horns, which are rounded at the point by a ball
peculiar to them; but when alarmed, they straighten these
horns, and proceed with a sidelong motion. They use these
horns when fighting with each other. The cray-fish is the
only animal that has the flesh in a pulpy state, and not firm
and solid, unless it is cooked alive in boiling water.</p>
<p>The cray-fish frequents rocky places, the crab spots which
present a soft surface. In winter they both choose such
parts of the shore as are exposed to the heat of the sun, in
summer they withdraw to the shady recesses of deep inlets
of the sea. All fish of this kind suffer from the cold of winter,
but become fat during autumn and spring, particularly
during the full moon; for the warmth of that luminary, as it
shines in the night, renders the temperature of the weather
more moderate.</p>
<p>There are various kinds of crabs, known as carabi, lobsters,
mai&aelig;, paguri, heracleotici, lions, and others of less note.
The carabus differs from other crabs, in having a tail; in
Ph&oelig;nicia they are called hippoi, or horses, being of such extraordinary
swiftness, that it is impossible to overtake them.
Crabs are long-lived, and have eight feet, all of which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
bent obliquely; besides which, the animal has two claws
with indented pincers. The upper part only of these forefeet
is movable: the right claw is the largest in them all.
Sometimes they assemble together in large bodies; but as
they are unable to cross the mouth of the Black Sea, they
turn back again and go round by land, and the road by which
they travel is to be seen all beaten down with their foot-marks.</p>
<p>The smallest crab known is the pinnotheres. It is peculiarly
exposed to danger, but its shrewdness is evinced by its
concealing itself in the shell of the oyster, removing as it
grows larger, to those of a larger size.</p>
<p>Crabs, when alarmed, go backwards as swiftly as when
moving forwards. They fight like rams, butting at each
other with their horns. They have a mode of curing themselves
of the bites of serpents. It is said, that while the sun
is passing through the sign of Cancer, the dead bodies of the
crabs, which are lying thrown up on the shore, are transformed
into serpents.</p>
<p>To the same class also belongs the sea-urchin, which has
spines in place of feet; its mode of moving along is to roll
like a ball, hence it is that these animals are often found with
their prickles rubbed off. Those among them which have the
longest spines of all, are known by the name of echinometr&aelig;,
while at the same time their body is the very smallest. They
are not all of them of the same glassy color; in the vicinity
of Torone they are white, with very short spines. The eggs
of all of them are bitter, and are five in number; the mouth
is situate in the middle of the body, and faces the earth. It
is said that these creatures foreknow the approach of a storm
at sea, and that they take up little stones with which they
cover themselves, and so provide a sort of ballast against
their volubility, for they are very unwilling by rolling along
to wear away their prickles. As soon as seafaring persons
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
observe this, they at once moor their ship with several anchors.</p>
<p>To the same genus also belong both land and water snails,
which thrust the body forth from their abode, and extend or
contract two horns. They are without eyes,<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a> and have,
therefore, to feel their way, by means of these horns.</p>
<p>To the same class belong the sea-scallops, which also conceal
themselves during severe frosts and great heats; as well
as the onyches, which shine in the dark like fire, and in the
mouth even while being eaten.</p>

<br />VARIOUS KINDS OF SHELL-FISH.</h2>
<p>Let us now pass on to the murex and other kinds of shell-fish,
which have a stronger shell, and in which Nature, in her
sportive mood, has displayed a great variety&mdash;so many are
the hues of their tints, so numerous are their shapes, flat, concave,
long, crescent-shaped, rounded into a globe, cut through
into a semi-globe, arched in the back, smooth, rough, indented,
streaked, the upper part spirally wreathed, the edge
projecting in a sharp point, the edge wreathed outwards, or
else folding inwards. And then, too, there are the various
distinctions of rayed shells, long-haired shells, wavy-haired
shells, channelled shells, pectinated shells, imbricated shells,
reticulated shells, shells with lines oblique or rectilinear, thickset
shells, expanded shells, tortuous shells, shells the valves
of which are united by one small knot, shells which are held
together all along one side, shells which are open as if in the
very act of applauding, and shells which wind, resembling a
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
conch. The fish of this class, known as the shells of Venus,
are able to navigate the surface of the deep, and, presenting
to the wind their concave side, catch the breeze, and sail
along on the surface of the sea. Scallops are also able to
leap and fly above the surface of the water, and they sometimes
employ their shell by way of a bark.</p>
<p>But why mention such trifles as these, when I am sensible
that no greater inroads have been made upon our morals, and
no more rapid advances have been made by luxury, than
those effected through the medium of shell-fish? Of all the
elements that exist, the sea is the one that costs the dearest
to the stomach; seeing that it provides so many kinds of
meats, so many dishes, so many exquisite flavors derived
from fish, all of which are valued in proportion to the danger
undergone by those who have caught them.</p>
<p>But how insignificant is all this when we come to think of
our purple, our azure, and our pearls; it was not enough, forsooth,
for the spoils of the sea to be thrust down the gullet&mdash;but
they must be employed as well to adorn the hands, the
ears, the head, the whole body, in fact, and that of the men
pretty nearly as much as the women. What has the sea to
do with our clothes? What is there in common between
waves and billows and a sheep&rsquo;s fleece? This one element
ought not to receive us, according to ordinary notions, except
in a state of nakedness. Let there be ever so strong an
alliance between it and the stomach, on the score of gluttony,
still, what can it possibly have to do with the back? It is not
enough, forsooth, that we are fed upon what is acquired by
perils, but we must be clothed, too, in a similar way; so true
it is, that for all the wants of the body, that which is sought
at the expense of human life is sure to please us the most.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c58"><span class="large">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />PEARLS.</h2>
<p>The very highest position among all valuables belongs to
the pearl. It is principally the Indian Ocean that sends
them to us. Across many a sea, and over many a lengthened
tract of land, scorched by the ardent rays of a burning sun,
must the pearl seeker pass, amid those monsters so frightful
and so huge which we have already described. The places
most productive of pearls are the islands of Taprobana and
Sto&iuml;dis, and Perimula, a promontory of India. But those
most highly valued are found in the vicinity of Arabia, in the
Persian Gulf, which forms a part of the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The origin and production of the shell-fish is not very different
from that of the shell of the oyster. When the genial
season of the year exercises its influence on the animal, it is
said that, yawning, as it were, it opens its shell, and so receives
a kind of dew, by means of which it becomes permeated;
and at length small, hard bunches form in its shell, in
the shape of pearls, which vary according to the quality of
the dew. If this has been in a perfectly pure state when it
flowed into the shell, then the pearl produced is white and
brilliant, but if it was turbid, the pearl is of a clouded color
also; if the sky should happen to have been lowering when it
was generated, the pearl will be of a pallid color; from all
which it is quite evident that the quality of the pearl depends
much more upon a calm state of the heavens than of the sea,
and contracts a cloudy hue, or a limpid appearance, according
to the degree of serenity of the sky in the morning.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>If, again, the fish is satiated in a reasonable time, then the
pearl produced increases rapidly in size. If it should happen
to lighten at the time, the animal shuts its shell, and the pearl
is diminished in size in proportion to the fast that the animal
has to endure: but if, in addition to this, it should thunder as
well, then it becomes alarmed, and closing the shell in an
instant, produces what is known as a physema, or pearl-bubble,
filled with air, and bearing a resemblance to a pearl, but
in appearance only, as it is quite empty, and devoid of body.
Those which are produced in a perfectly healthy state consist
of numerous layers. It is wonderful, however, that they
should be influenced thus pleasurably, by the state of the
heavens, seeing that by the action of the sun the pearls are
turned of a red color, and lose all their whiteness, just like
the human body. Those which keep their whiteness the best
are the pelagi&aelig;, or main-sea pearls, which lie at too great
a depth to be reached by the sun&rsquo;s rays. Those pearls
which have one surface flat and the other spherical, opposite
to the plane side, are for that reason called tympania, or
tambour-pearls. I have seen pearls still adhering to the
shell; for which reason the shells were used as boxes for
unguents.</p>
<p>As soon as the fish perceives the hand, it shuts its shell
and covers up its treasures, being well aware what is sought;
if it happens to catch the fingers it cuts them off with the
sharp edge of the shell. No punishment could be more
justly inflicted. There are other penalties as well, for while
the greater part of the pearls are only to be found among
rocks and crags, the others which lie out in the main sea are
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
generally accompanied by sea-dogs.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a> And yet, for all this,
the women will not banish these gems from their ears!
Some writers say, that these animals live in communities, or
swarms like bees, each of them being governed by one remarkable
for its size and venerable age; while at the same
time it is possessed of marvellous skill in taking all due precautions
against danger; the divers take special care to find
these, because when once they are taken, the others stray to
and fro, and are easily caught in their nets. When the pearl-fish
are taken they are placed under a thick layer of salt in
earthen-ware vessels; as the flesh is gradually consumed, the
pearls are disengaged and fall to the bottom of the vessel.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that pearls wear out with use, and will
change their color, if neglected. All their merit consists in
their whiteness, large size, roundness, polish, and weight;
qualities which are not easily to be found united in the same.
Indeed no two pearls are ever found perfectly alike; and it
was from this circumstance, no doubt, that our Roman luxury
first gave them the name of &ldquo;unio,&rdquo; or the unique gem: for a
similar name is not given them by the Greeks; nor among
the barbarians by whom they are found are they called anything
else but &ldquo;margarit&aelig;.&rdquo; Even in the very whiteness of
the pearl there is a great difference to be observed. Those
are of a much clearer water that are found in the Red Sea,
while the Indian pearl resembles in tint the scales of the mirror-stone,
but exceeds all the others in size. The color that
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
is most highly prized of all is that of the alum-colored
pearls. Long pearls have their peculiar value, especially
those called &ldquo;elenchi,&rdquo; which are of a long tapering shape,
resembling our alabaster<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a> boxes in form, and ending in a full
bulb. Our ladies quite glory in having these suspended from
their fingers, or two or three of them dangling from their
ears. For the purpose of ministering to these luxurious
tastes, there are various names and wearisome refinements
which have been devised by profuseness and prodigality; for
after inventing these ear-rings, they have given them the
name of &ldquo;crotalia,&rdquo; or castanet pendants, as though quite
delighted even with the rattling of the pearls as they knock
against each other; and, at the present day, the poorer classes
are affecting them, as people are in the habit of saying, that
&ldquo;a pearl worn by a woman in public, is as good as a lictor
walking before her.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a> Nay, even more than this, they
put them on their feet, and that, not only on the laces of their
sandals, but all over the shoes; it is not enough to wear
pearls, but they must tread upon them, and walk with them
under foot as well.</p>
<p>Pearls used formerly to be found in our sea, but more frequently
about the Thracian Bosporus; they were of a red
color, and small, and enclosed in a shell-fish known by the
name of &ldquo;myes.&rdquo; In Acarnania there is a shell-fish called
&ldquo;pina,&rdquo; which produces pearls; and Juba states that on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
shores of Arabia a shell-fish is found which resembles a
notched comb, covered all over with hair like a sea-urchin, and
the pearl lies imbedded in its flesh, bearing a strong resemblance
to a hailstone. No such shell-fish, however, as these
are ever brought to Rome. The Acarnanian pearl is shapeless,
rough, and of a marble hue; those are better which are
found in the vicinity of Actium.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that the interior of the pearl is solid, as no
fall is able to break it. Pearls are found in various places in
the body of the animal. Indeed, I have seen some which lay
at the edge of the shell, just as though in the very act of coming
forth, and in some fishes as many as four or five. Up to
the present time, very few have been found which exceeded
half an ounce in weight, by more than one scruple.<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> It is a
well-ascertained fact, that in Britannia pearls are found,
though small, and of bad color; for the deified Julius C&aelig;sar
wished it to be distinctly understood, that the breast-plate
which he dedicated to Venus Genetrix, in her temple, was
made of British pearls.</p>
<p>I once saw Lollia Paulina, the wife of the Emperor Caligula&mdash;it
was not at any public festival, or any solemn ceremonial,
but only an ordinary wedding entertainment&mdash;covered with
emeralds and pearls, which shone in alternate layers upon her
head, in her hair, in her wreaths, in her ears, upon her neck,
in her bracelets, and on her fingers, and the value of which
amounted in all to forty millions of sesterces ($1,525,000);
indeed she was prepared at once to prove the fact, by showing
the receipts and acquittances. Nor were these any presents
made by a prodigal potentate, but treasures which had
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
descended to her from her grandfather, and obtained by the
spoliation of the provinces. Such are the fruits of plunder
and extortion! It was for this reason that Marcus Lollius
was held so infamous all over the East for the presents which
he extorted from the kings; as a result of which he was
finally denied the friendship of Caius C&aelig;sar, and took poison;
and all this was done, I say, that his granddaughter might be
seen, by the glare of lamps, covered all over with jewels to
the amount of forty millions of sesterces! Now let a person
only picture to himself, on the one hand, what was the value
of the habits worn by Curius or Fabricius in their triumphs,
let him picture to himself the objects displayed to the public
on their triumphal litters, and then, on the other hand, let
him think upon this Lollia, this one bit of a woman, the head
of an empire, taking her place at table, thus attired; would
he not much rather that the conquerors had been torn from
their very chariots, than that they had conquered for such a
result as this?</p>
<p>Yet even these are not the most supreme evidences of luxury.
There were formerly two pearls, the largest that had
been ever seen in the whole world: Cleopatra, the last of the
queens of Egypt, came into possession of them both, by
descent from the kings of the East. When Antony had been
sated by her, day after day, with the most exquisite banquets,
this queenly woman, inflated with vanity and disdainful arrogance,
affected to treat all this sumptuousness and all these
vast preparations with the greatest contempt; upon which
Antony enquired what there was that could possibly be
added to such extraordinary magnificence. To this she made
answer, that on a single entertainment she would expend ten
millions of sesterces. Antony was extremely desirous to
learn how that could be done, but looked upon it as a thing
quite impossible; and a wager was the result. On the following
day, upon which the matter was to be decided, in
order that she might not lose the wager, she had an entertainment
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
set before Antony, magnificent in every respect,
though no better than his usual repast. Upon this, Antony
joked her, and enquired what was the amount expended upon
it; to which she made answer that the banquet which he then
beheld was only a trifling appendage to the real banquet, and
that she alone would consume at the meal to the ascertained
value of that amount, she herself would swallow the ten millions
of sesterces; and so ordered the second course to be
served. In obedience to her instructions, the servants placed
before her a single vessel, which was filled with vinegar, a
liquid, the sharpness and strength of which is able to dissolve
pearls. At this moment she was wearing in her ears those
choicest and most unique productions of Nature; and while
Antony was waiting to see what she was going to do, taking
one of them from out of her ear, she threw it into
the vinegar, and as soon as it was melted, swallowed it.
Lucius Plancus, who had been named umpire in the wager,
placed his hand upon the other at the very instant that she
was making preparations to dissolve it in a similar manner,
and declared that Antony had lost&mdash;an omen, which, in the
result, was fully confirmed. The fame of the second pearl is
equal to that which attends its fellow. After the queen, who
had thus come off victorious on so important a question, had
been seized, it was cut asunder, in order that this, the other
half of the entertainment, might serve as pendants for the
ears of Venus, in the Pantheon at Rome.</p>
<p>Antony and Cleopatra, however, will not bear away the
palm of prodigality in this respect, and will be stripped of
even this boast in the annals of luxury. For before their
time, Clodius, the son of the tragic actor, &AElig;sopus, had done
the same at Rome; having been left by his father heir to his
ample wealth and possessions. Let not Antony then be too
proud, for all his triumvirate, since he can hardly stand in
comparison with an actor; one, too, who had no wager to
induce him&mdash;a thing which adds to the regal munificence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
the act&mdash;but was merely desirous of trying, by way of glorification
to his palate, what was the taste of pearls. As he
found it to be wonderfully pleasing, that he might not be the
only one to know it, he had a pearl set before each of his
guests for him to swallow. After the surrender of Alexandria,
pearls came into common and, indeed, universal use at
Rome; but they first began to be used about the time of
Sylla, though but of small size and of little value, Fenestella
says&mdash;in this, however, it is quite evident that he is mistaken,
for &AElig;lius Stilo tells us, that it was in the time of the Jugurthine
war, that the name of &ldquo;unio&rdquo; was first given to pearls
of remarkable size.</p>
<h2 id="c59"><span class="large">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE NATURE OF THE MUREX AND THE PURPLE.</h2>
<p>And yet pearls may be looked upon as pretty nearly a possession
of everlasting duration&mdash;they descend from a man to
his heir, and they are alienated from one to another just like
any landed estate. But the colors that are extracted from the
murex and the &ldquo;purple&rdquo; fade from hour to hour; and yet
luxury, which has similarly acted as a mother to them, has set
upon them prices almost equal to those of pearls.</p>
<p>Purples commonly live seven years. Like the murex, they
keep themselves in concealment for thirty days, about the
time of the rising of the Dog-star; in the spring season they
unite in large bodies, and by rubbing against each other, produce
a viscous saliva, from which a kind of wax is formed.
The murex does the same; but the purple has that exquisite
juice which is so greatly sought after for the purpose of dyeing
cloth, situated in the middle of the throat. This secretion
consists of a tiny drop contained in a white vein, from which
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
the precious liquid used for dyeing is distilled, being of the
tint of a rose somewhat inclining to black. The rest of the
body is entirely destitute of this juice. It is a great point to
take the fish alive; for when it dies, it ejects this juice.
From the larger ones it is extracted after taking off the shell;
but the small fish are crushed alive, together with the shells,
upon which they eject this secretion.</p>
<p>In Asia the best purple is that of Tyre, in Africa that of
Meninx and the parts of G&aelig;tulia that border on the Ocean,
and in Europe that of Laconia. It is for this color that the
fasces and the axes of Rome make way in the crowd; it is this
that asserts the majesty of childhood;<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> it is this that distinguishes
the senator from the man of equestrian rank; by persons
arrayed in this color are prayers addressed to propitiate
the gods; on every garment it sheds a lustre, and in the triumphal
vestment it is to be seen mingled with gold. Let us
be prepared then to excuse this frantic passion for purple,
even though at the same time we are compelled to enquire,
why it is that such a high value has been set upon the produce
of this shell-fish, seeing that while in the dye the smell of it is
offensive, and the color then is harsh, of a greenish hue, and
strongly resembling that of the sea when in a tempestuous
state?</p>
<p>The tongue of the purple is a finger in length, and by
means of this it finds subsistence, by piercing other shell-fish,
so hard is the point of it. They die in fresh water, and in
places where rivers discharge themselves into the sea; otherwise,
when taken, they will live as long as fifty days on their
saliva. All shell-fish grow very fast, purples especially; they
come to their full size at the end of a year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Were I at this point to pass on to other subjects, luxury, no
doubt, would think itself defrauded of its due, and so accuse
me of negligence; I must therefore make my way into the
very workshops, so that, just as among articles of food the
various kinds and qualities of corn are known, all those who
place the enjoyment of life in these luxuries may have a still
better acquaintance with the objects for which they live.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of fish that produce the purple color;
the elements in both are the same, the combinations only are
different; the smaller fish is that which is called the &ldquo;buccinum,&rdquo;
from its resemblance to the conch by which the sound
of the buccinus or trumpet is produced, and to this circumstance
it owes its name: the opening in it is round, with an
incision in the margin. The other fish is known as the &ldquo;purpura,&rdquo;
or purple, and has a grooved and projecting muzzle,
which being tubulated on one side in the interior, forms a
passage for the tongue; besides which, the shell is studded
with points up to the very apex, which are ordinarily seven in
number, and disposed in a circle; these are not found on the
buccinum, though both of them have as many spirals as they
are years old. The buccinum attaches itself only to crags,
and is gathered about rocky places.</p>
<p>Purples are of numerous kinds, differing only in their element
and place of abode. There is the mud purple, the sea-weed
purple, both of which are held in the very lowest esteem;
the reef-purple, which is collected on the reefs or out at sea;
the color from which is still too light and thin. Then there is
the variety known as the pebble-purple, wonderfully well
adapted for dyeing; and, better than any of them, that known
by the name of &ldquo;dialutensis,&rdquo; because of the various natures
of the soil on which it feeds. Purples are taken with a kind
of osier kipe of small size, and with large meshes; these are
cast into the sea, baited with cockles which snap at an object,
just as we see mussels do, and close the shell instantaneously.
Though half dead when they are returned to the sea, these
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
animals come to life again, and open their shells with avidity;
upon which the purples seek them, and commence the attack,
by protruding their tongues. The cockles, on the other hand,
the moment they feel themselves pricked, shut their shells,
and hold fast the object that has wounded them: in this way,
victims to their greediness, they are drawn up to the surface
hanging by the tongue.</p>
<p>The most favorable season for taking these fish is after the
rising of the Dog-star, or else before spring; for when they
have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have
no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers&rsquo;
workshops, although it is a point of primary importance.
After it is taken, the vein is extracted, of which we have previously
spoken, to which it is requisite to add salt, twenty
ounces to every hundred pounds of juice. They are then left
to steep for a period not exceeding three days, for the fresher
they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then
set to boil in vessels of tin, and every eight thousand pounds
ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by
the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the
vessel is placed at the end of a long funnel, communicating
with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed
from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres
to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole
contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a
fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged
into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the
color is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the
liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red
is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue.
The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after
carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the
color of that bright lustre, which approaches the shining
crimson hue of the kermes-berry, a tint that is particularly
valued.</p>

<br />BODIES WHICH HAVE A THIRD NATURE, THAT OF THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE COMBINED.</h2>
<p>For my own part, I am strongly of opinion that there is
sense existing in those bodies which have the nature of neither
animals nor vegetables, but a third which partakes of them
both:&mdash;sea-nettles and sponges, I mean. The sea-nettle wanders
to and fro by night, and at night changes its locality.
These creatures are by nature a sort of fleshy branch, and are
nurtured upon flesh. They have the power of producing a
smarting pain, just like that caused by the nettle found on
land. For the purpose of seeking its prey, it contracts and
stiffens itself to the utmost possible extent, and then, as a
small fish swims past, it will suddenly spread out its branches,
and so seize and devour it. At another time it will assume
the appearance of being quite withered away, and let itself be
tossed to and fro by the waves like a piece of sea-weed, until
it happens to touch a fish. The moment it does so, the fish
goes to rub itself against a rock, to get rid of the itching; immediately
upon which, the nettle pounces upon it. By night
also it is on the look-out for scallops and sea-urchins. When
it perceives a hand approaching it, it instantly changes its
color, and contracts itself; when touched it produces a burning
sensation, and if ever so short a time is afforded, makes
its escape.</p>
<p>Sponges grow on rocks, and feed upon shell- and other fish,
and slime. It would appear that these creatures, too, have
some intelligence; for as soon as they feel the hand about to
tear them off, they contract themselves, and are separated
with much greater difficulty: they do the same also when the
waves buffet them to and fro. About Torone it is said that
they will survive after they have been detached, and that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
grow again from the roots which have been left adhering to
the rock. They leave a color like blood upon the rock from
which they have been detached, especially those which are
produced in the Syrtes of Africa.</p>
<p>The manos is the one that grows to the largest size, but the
softest of all are those found in the vicinity of Lycia. Where
the sea is deep and calm, they are more particularly soft,
while those which are found in the Hellespont are rough, and
those in the vicinity of Malea coarse. When lying in places
exposed to the sun, they become putrid: hence those which
are found in deep water are the best. While they are alive,
they are of the same blackish color that they are when saturated
with water. They adhere to the rock not by one part
only, nor yet by the whole body: and within them there are a
number of empty tubes, generally four or five in number, by
means of which, it is thought, they take their food. There
are other tubes also, but these are closed at the upper extremity;
and a sort of membrane is supposed to be spread beneath
the roots by which they adhere. It is well known that
sponges are very long-lived.</p>
<h2 id="c61"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />THE SHARK.</h2>
<p>Vast numbers of sharks infest the seas in the vicinity of
the sponges, to the great peril of those who dive for them.
These persons say that a sort of dense cloud gradually thickens
over their heads, bearing a resemblance to some kind of
animal like a flat-fish, and that, pressing downward upon them,
it prevents them from returning to the surface. It is for this
reason that they carry stilettos with them, very sharp at the
point, and attached to them by strings; for if they did not
pierce the object with the help of these, it could not be got
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
rid of. This, however, is entirely the result, in my opinion, of
the darkness and their own fears; for no person has ever yet
been able to find, among living creatures, the fish-cloud or the
fish-fog, the name which they give to this enemy of theirs.</p>
<p>The divers, however, have terrible combats with the sharks,
which attack with avidity the groin, the heels, and all the
whiter parts of the body. The only means of ensuring safety,
is to go boldly to meet them, and so, by taking the initiative,
strike them with alarm: for in fact, this animal is just as
much frightened at man, as man is at it; and they are on
quite an equal footing when beneath the water. But the moment
the diver has reached the surface, the danger is much
more imminent; for he loses the power of boldly meeting
his adversary while he is endeavoring to make his way out of
the water, and his only chance of safety is in his companions,
who draw him along by a cord that is fastened under his
shoulders. While he is engaging with the enemy, he keeps
pulling this cord with his left hand, according as there may be
any sign of immediate peril, while with the right he wields
the stiletto, which he is using in his defence. At first they
draw him along at a moderate pace, but as soon as they have
got him close to the ship, if they do not whip him out in an
instant, with the greatest possible celerity, they see him
snapped asunder: and many a time, too, the diver, even
when already drawn out, is dragged from their hands, through
neglecting to aid the efforts of those who are assisting him,
by rolling up his body in the shape of a ball. The others, it
is true, are in the mean time brandishing their pronged fish-spears;
but the monster has the craftiness to place himself
beneath the ship, and so wage the warfare in safety. Consequently,
every possible care is taken by the divers to look out
for the approach of this enemy.</p>
<p>The surest sign of safety is to see flat-fish, which never frequent
the spots where these noxious monsters are found: and
for this reason the divers call them sacred.</p>

<h2 id="c62"><span class="large">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />OYSTER-BEDS, AND FISH-PRESERVES.</h2>
<p>The first person who formed artificial oyster-beds was Sergius
Orata, who established them at Bai&aelig;, in the time of
Lucius Crassus, the orator, just before the Marsic War.
This was done by him, not for the gratification of gluttony,
but as a commercial venture, and he contrived to make a large
income by this exercise of his ingenuity. He was the first to
invent hanging baths over heating furnaces, and after buying
villas and trimming them up, he would every now and then
sell them again. He, too, was the first to adjudge the pre&euml;minence
for delicacy of flavor to the oysters of Lake Lucrinus;
for every kind of aquatic animal is superior in one place
to what it is in another. Thus, for instance, the wolf-fish of
the river Tiber is the best that is caught between the two
bridges, and the turbot of Ravenna is the most esteemed, the
murena of Sicily, the elops of Rhodes; the same, too, as to
the other kinds, not to go through all the items of the culinary
catalogue. The British shores had not as yet sent their
supplies, at the time when Orata thus ennobled the Lucrine
oysters: at a later period, however, it was thought worth
while to fetch oysters all the way from Brundisium, at the
very extremity of Italy; and in order that there might exist
no rivalry between the two flavors, a plan has been more recently
hit upon, of feeding the oysters of Brundisium in Lake
Lucrinus, famished as they must naturally be after so long a
journey.</p>
<p>In the same age, Lucinius Murena was the first to form preserves
for other fish; and his example was soon followed by
the noble families of the Philippi and the Hortensii. Lucullus
had a mountain pierced near Naples, at a greater outlay
even than that which had been expended on his villa, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
order to admit the sea to his preserves. For this reason
Pompey gave him the name of &ldquo;Xerxes in a toga.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> After
his death, the fish in his preserves were sold for the sum of
four million sesterces ($150,000).</p>
<p>C. Hirrus was the first person who formed preserves for the
murena; he lent six thousand of these fishes for the triumphal
banquets of C&aelig;sar the Dictator; on which occasion he had
them duly weighed, as he declined to receive the value of
them in money or any other commodity. His villa, which
was of a very humble character in the interior, sold for four
millions of sesterces, in consequence of the valuable nature of
the stock-ponds there. Next after this, there arose a passion
for individual fish. At Bauli, in the territory of Bai&aelig;, the
orator Hortensius had some fish-preserves, in which there was
a murena to which he became so much attached, as to be
supposed to have wept on hearing of its death. It was at the
same villa that Antonia, the wife of Drusus, placed earrings
upon a murena which she had become fond of; the report of
which singular circumstance attracted many visitors to the
place.</p>
<p>Fulvius Lupinus first formed preserves for sea-snails, in the
territory of Tarquinii, shortly before the civil war between
C&aelig;sar and Pompey. He also carefully distinguished them by
their several species, separating them from one another. The
white ones were those that are produced in the district of
Reate; those of Illyria were remarkable for the largeness of
their size; while those from Africa were the most prolific;
those, however, from the Promontory of the Sun were the most
esteemed of all. For the purpose of fattening them, he invented
a mixture of boiled wine, spelt-meal, and other substances;
so that fattened periwinkles became quite an object
of gastronomy; and the art of breeding them was brought to
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
such a pitch of perfection, that the shell of a single animal
would hold as much as eighty quadrantes (fifteen quarts).
This we learn from Marcus Varro.</p>
<h2 id="c63"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />LAND FISHES.</h2>
<p>There are still some wonderful kinds of fishes which we find
mentioned by Theophrastus: he says, that when the waters
subside, which have been admitted for the purposes of irrigation
in the vicinity of Babylon, there are certain fish which
remain in such holes as may contain water; from these they
come forth for the purpose of feeding, moving along with
their fins by the aid of a rapid movement of the tail. If pursued,
he says, they retreat to their holes, and when they have
reached them, will turn round and make a stand. The head
is like that of the sea frog, while the other parts are similar to
those of the gobio, and they have gills like other fish. He
says also, that in the vicinity of Heraclea and Cromna, and
about the river Lycus, as well as in many parts of the Black
Sea, there is one kind of fish which frequents the waters near
the banks of the rivers, and makes holes for itself, in which it
lives, even when the water retires and the bed of the river is
dry; for which reason these fishes have to be dug out of the
ground, and only show by the movement of the body that they
are still alive. He says also, that in the vicinity of the same
Heraclea, when the river Lycus ebbs, the eggs are left in the
mud, and that the fish, on being produced from these, go
forth to seek their food by means of a sort of fluttering motion,&mdash;their
gills being but very small, in consequence of
which they are not in need of water. It is in this way that
eels also can live so long out of water; and that their eggs
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
come to maturity on dry land, like those of the sea-tortoise.
In the same regions of the Black Sea, he says, various kinds
of fishes are overtaken by the ice, the gobio more particularly,
and they only betray signs of life, by moving when they have
warmth applied by the saucepan. All these things, however,
though very remarkable, still admit of some explanation.</p>
<h2 id="c64"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />HOW THE FISH CALLED THE ANTHIAS IS TAKEN.</h2>
<p>It would not be right to omit what is said about the fish
called anthias, and which I find is looked upon as true by
most writers. I have already mentioned the Chelidoni&aelig;, certain
islands off the coast of Asia, in the midst of a sea full of
crags and reefs. These parts are much frequented by this
fish, which is very speedily taken by the employment of a
single method of catching it. A fisherman pushes out in a
little boat, dressed in a color resembling that of his boat; and
every day, for several days together, at the same hour, he
sails over the same space, while doing which he throws a
quantity of bait into the sea. Whatever is thrown from the
boat is an object of suspicion to the fish, who keep at a distance
from what causes them so much alarm; but after this
has been repeated a considerable number of times, one of the
fish, reassured by becoming habituated to the scene, at last
snaps at the bait. The movements of this one are watched
with the greatest care and attention, for in it are centred all
the hopes of the fishermen, as it is to be the means of securing
them their prey; nor is it difficult to recognize it, seeing that
for some days it is the only one that ventures to come near
the bait. At last, however, it finds some others to follow its
example, and by degrees it is better and better attended, till
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
at last it brings with it shoals innumerable. The older ones,
at length becoming quite accustomed to the fisherman, easily
recognize him, and will even take food from his hands.
Upon this, the man throws out, a little way beyond the tips of
his fingers, a hook concealed in a bait, and smuggles them out
one by one, standing in the shadow of the boat and whipping
them out of the water with a slight jerk, that the others may
not perceive it. Meantime another fisherman is ready inside
to receive them upon pieces of cloth, in order that no floundering
about or other noise may scare the others away. It is
of importance to know
which has been the betrayer
of the others, and
not to take it, otherwise
the shoal will take to
flight, and appear no
more for the future.
There is a story that a
fisherman who quarrelled
once with his mate,
threw out a hook to one of these leading fishes, which he
easily recognized, and so captured it with a malicious intent.
But the fish was recognized in the market by the other
fisherman, against whom he had conceived this malice; who
accordingly brought an action against him for damages; and,
as Mucianus adds, he was condemned to pay them on the
hearing of the case. These anthi&aelig;, it is said, when they
see one of their number taken with a hook, cut the line
with the serrated spines which they have on the back, the
one that is held fast stretching it out as much as it can, to
enable them to cut it.</p>

<br />THE ECHENE&Iuml;S AND THE TORPEDO.</h2>
<p>Following the proper order of things, we have now arrived
at the culminating point of the wonders manifested to us by
the operations of Nature. For what is there more unruly
than the sea, with its winds, its tornadoes, and its tempests?
And yet in what department of her works has Nature been
more seconded by the ingenuity of man, than in this, by his
inventions of sails and of oars? In addition to this, we are
struck with the ineffable might displayed by the Ocean&rsquo;s tides,
as they constantly ebb and flow, and so regulate the currents
of the sea as though they were the waters of one vast river.</p>
<p>And yet all these forces, though acting in unison, and impelling
in the same direction, a single fish, and that of a very
diminutive size&mdash;the fish known as the &ldquo;echene&iuml;s&rdquo;&mdash;possesses
the power of counteracting. Winds may blow and storms
may rage, and yet the echene&iuml;s controls their fury, restrains
their mighty force, and bids ships stand still in their career; a
result which no cables, no anchors, from their ponderousness
quite incapable of being weighed, could ever have produced!
A fish bridles the impetuous violence of the deep, and subdues
the frantic rage of the universe&mdash;and all this by no effort
of its own, no act of resistance on its part, no act at all, in
fact, but that of adhering to the bark! Trifling as this object
would appear, it suffices to counteract all these forces combined,
and to forbid the ship to pass onward in its way!
Fleets, armed for war, pile up towers and bulwarks on their
decks, in order that, upon the deep even, men may fight from
behind ramparts as it were. But alas for human vanity!&mdash;when
their prows, beaked as they are with bronze and with
iron, and armed for the onset, can thus be arrested and riveted
to the spot by a little fish, no more than half a foot in length!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>At the battle of Actium, it is said, a fish of this kind stopped
the pr&aelig;torian ship<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a> of Antonius in its course, at the moment
that he was hastening from ship to ship to encourage and exhort
his men, and so compelled him to leave it and go on
board another. So that the fleet of C&aelig;sar gained the advantage
in the onset, and charged with a redoubled impetuosity.
In our own time, too, one of these fish arrested the ship of
the Emperor Caius Caligula in its course, when he was returning
from Astura to Antium: and thus, as the result
proved, did an insignificant fish give presage of great events;
for no sooner had the emperor returned to Rome than he was
pierced by the weapons of his own soldiers. Nor did this
sudden stoppage of the ship long remain a mystery, the cause
being perceived upon finding that, out of the whole fleet, the
emperors five-banked galley was the only one that was making
no way. The moment this was discovered, some of the
sailors plunged into the sea, and, on making search about the
ship&rsquo;s sides, they found an echene&iuml;s adhering to the rudder.
Upon its being shown to the emperor, he strongly expressed
his indignation<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a> that such an obstacle as this should have
impeded his progress, and have rendered powerless the hearty
endeavors of four hundred men, particularly as the fish had
no such power when brought on board.</p>
<p>According to the persons who examined it on that occasion,
and who have seen it since, the echene&iuml;s bears a strong resemblance
to a large slug. Some of our own authors have given
this fish the Latin name of &ldquo;mora.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>If we had not this illustration by the agency of the echene&iuml;s,
would it not have been quite sufficient only to cite the instance
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
of the torpedo, another inhabitant also of the sea, as a manifestation
of the mighty powers of Nature? From a considerable
distance even, and if only touched with the end of a
spear or a staff, this fish has the property of benumbing even
the most vigorous arm, and of riveting the feet of the runner,
however swift he may be in the race.</p>
<h2 id="c66"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />THE INSTINCTS AND PECULIARITIES OF FISHES.</h2>
<p>The statements which Ovid has made as to the instincts of
fish, in the work<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> of his known as the &ldquo;Treatise on Fishes,&rdquo;
appear to me truly marvellous. The scarus, for instance,
when enclosed in the wicker kype, makes no effort to escape
with its head, nor does it attempt to thrust its muzzle between
the oziers; but turning its tail towards them, it enlarges the
orifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so makes its escape
backwards. Should, too, another scarus, from without,
chance to see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take
the tail of the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts
to escape. The lupus, again, when surrounded with the net,
furrows the sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the
net has passed over it. The mur&aelig;na, trusting in the slippery
smoothness of its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of
the net, and by repeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape.
The polyp makes for the hooks, and without swallowing
the bait, clasps it with its feelers; nor does it quit its hold
until it has eaten off the bait, or perceives itself being drawn
out of the water by the rod.</p>
<p>The mullet, too, is aware that within the bait there is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
hook concealed, and is on its guard against the ambush; still,
however, so great is its voracity, that it beats the hook with
its tail, and strikes away from it the bait. The lupus, again,
shows less foresight and address, but repentance at its imprudence
arms it with mighty strength; for, when caught by the
hook, it flounders from side to side, and so widens the wound,
till at last the insidious hook falls from its mouth. The mur&aelig;na
not only swallows the hook, but catches at the line with
its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias, Ovid says,
the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns its body
with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharp knife-like
fin, and so cuts the line asunder.</p>
<p>Trebius Niger informs us that whenever the loligo is seen
darting above the surface of the water, it portends a change of
weather: that the xiphias, or, in other words, the sword-fish,
has a sharp-pointed muzzle, with which it is able to pierce the
sides of a ship and send it to the bottom: instances of which
have been known near Cotte, a place in Mauritania, not far
from the river Lixus. He says, too, that the loligo sometimes
darts above the surface, in such vast numbers, as to sink the
ships upon which they fall.</p>
<p>At many of the country-seats belonging to the Emperor the
fish eat<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a> from the hand. In the fountain of Jupiter at Labranda,
there are eels which eat from the hand, and wear earrings.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a></p>
<p>At Myra, too, in Lycia, the fish in the Fountain of Apollo,
known as Surium, appear and give oracular presages, when
thrice summoned by the sound of a flute. If they seize the
flesh thrown to them with avidity, it is a good omen for the
person who consults them; but if, on the other hand, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
flap at it with their tails, it is considered an evil presage. At
Hierapolis,<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> in Syria, the fish in the Lake of Venus obey
the voice of the officers of the temple: bedecked with ornaments
of gold, they come at their call, fawn upon them
while they are scratched, and open their mouths so wide as to
admit of the insertion of the hand.</p>
<h2 id="c67"><span class="large">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br />CORAL.</h2>
<p>In the same degree that people in our part of the world set
a value upon the pearls of India do the people of India
prize coral: it being the prevailing taste in each nation
respectively that constitutes the value of things. Coral is
produced in the Red Sea also, but of a more swarthy hue
than ours. It is to be found also in the Persian Gulf, where
it is known by the name of &ldquo;iace.&rdquo; But the most highly-esteemed
of all, is that produced in the vicinity of the islands
called St&oelig;chades, in the Gallic Gulf, and near the &AElig;olian
Islands and the town of Drepana in the Sea of Sicily. Coral
is to be found growing, too, at Erythr&aelig;, where it is intensely
red, but soft, and consequently little valued.</p>
<p>Its form is that of a shrub,<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> and its color green: its berries
are white and soft while under water, but the moment they
are removed from it, they become hard and red, resembling
the berries of cultivated cornel in size and appearance. They
say that, while alive, if it is only touched by a person, it will
immediately become as hard as stone; and hence it is that the
greatest pains are taken to prevent this, by tearing it up from
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
the bottom with nets, or else cutting it short with a sharp-edged
instrument of iron: from which last circumstance it is generally
supposed to have received its name of &ldquo;curalium.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a>
The reddest coral and the most branchy is held in the highest
esteem; but, at the same time, it must not be rough or hard
like stone; nor yet, on the other hand, should it be full of
holes or hollow.</p>
<p>The berries of coral are no less esteemed by the men in
India than are the pearls of that country by the ladies among
us; their soothsayers, too, and diviners look upon coral as an
amulet endowed with sacred properties, and a sure preservative
against all dangers: hence it is that they equally value it
as an ornament and as an object of devotion. Before it was
known in what estimation coral was held by the people of
India, the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their swords,
shields, and helmets with it; but at the present day, owing to
the value set upon it as an article of exportation, it has become
so extremely rare, that it is seldom to be seen even in
the regions that produce it. Branches of coral, hung at the
neck of infants, are thought to act as a preservative against
danger. Calcined, pulverized, and taken in wine, or, if there
are symptoms of fever, in water, it acts as a soporific. It resists
the action of fire a considerable time before it is calcined.</p>
<h2 id="c68"><span class="large">CHAPTER XXI.</span>
<br />THE VARIOUS KINDS OF OYSTERS.</h2>
<p>The palm has been awarded to oysters at our tables as a
most exquisite dish. Oysters love fresh water and spots
where numerous rivers discharge themselves into the sea.
Generally speaking, they increase in size with the increase of
the moon, but it is at the beginning of summer, more particularly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
and when the rays of the sun penetrate the shallow
waters, that they are swollen with an abundance of milk.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a></p>
<p>Oysters are of various colors; in Spain they are red, in
Illyricum of a tawny hue, and at Circeii black, both in meat
and shell. But in every country, those oysters are the most
highly esteemed that are compact without being slimy from
their secretions, and are remarkable more for their thickness
than their breadth. They should never be taken in either
muddy or sandy spots, but from a firm, hard bottom; the
meat should be compressed, and not of a fleshy consistence;
and the oyster should be free from fringed edges, and lying
wholly in the cavity of the shell. Persons of experience in
these matters add another characteristic; a fine purple thread,
they say, should run round the margins of the beard, this
being looked upon as a sign of superior quality, and obtaining
for them their name of &ldquo;calliblephara.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
<p>Oysters are all the better for travelling and being removed
to new waters; thus, for example, the oysters of Brundisium,
it is thought, when fed in the waters of Avernus, both retain
their own native juices and acquire the flavor of those of
Lake Lucrinus. Mucianus, who is really a connoisseur, says:&mdash;&ldquo;The
oysters of Cyzicus are larger than those of Lake
Lucrinus, fresher than those of the British coasts,<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a> sweeter
than those of Medul&aelig;, more tasty than those of Ephesus,
more plump than those of Lucas, less slimy than those of
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
Coryphas, more delicate than those of Istria, and whiter than
those of Circeii.&rdquo; For all this, however, it is a fact well ascertained
that there are no oysters fresher or more delicate than
those of Circeii, last mentioned.</p>
<p>According to the historians of the expedition of Alexander,
there were oysters found in the Indian Sea a foot in diameter:<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a>
among ourselves, too, the nomenclature of some spendthrift
and gourmand has found for certain oysters the name of
&ldquo;tridacna,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a> wishing it to be understood thereby, that they
are so large as to require three bites in eating them. We will
take the present opportunity of stating all the medicinal properties
that are attributed to oysters. They are singularly
refreshing<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a> to the stomach, and tend to restore the appetite.
Luxury, too, has imparted to them an additional coolness by
burying them in snow, thus making a medley of the produce
of the tops of mountains and the bottom of the sea. Calcined
oyster-shells, mixed with honey, are good sprinkled
upon burns, and are highly esteemed as a dentifrice.</p>

<br />THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.</h2>
<h2 id="c69"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />THE OSTRICH.</h2>
<p>The history of birds follows next, the very largest of which,
and indeed almost approaching to the nature of quadrupeds,
is the ostrich of Africa or &AElig;thiopia. This bird exceeds in
height a man sitting on horseback, and can surpass him in
swiftness, as wings have been given to aid it in running; in
other respects ostriches cannot be considered as birds, and do
not raise themselves from the earth. They have cloven
talons, very similar to the hoof of the stag; with these they
fight, and they also employ them in seizing stones for the
purpose of throwing at those who pursue them.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a> They have
the marvellous property of being able to digest every substance
without distinction, but their stupidity is no less remarkable;
for although the rest of their body is so large, they
imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a
bush, that the whole of the body is concealed. Their eggs
are prized on account of their large size, and are employed as
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
vessels for certain purposes, while the feathers of the wing
and tail are used as ornaments for the crest and helmet of the
warrior.</p>
<h2 id="c70"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE PH&OElig;NIX.</h2>
<p>&AElig;thiopia and India, more especially, produce birds of
diversified plumage, and such as quite surpass all description.
In the front rank of these is the ph&oelig;nix,<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a> that famous bird of
Arabia; though I am not quite sure that its existence is not
all a fable. It is said that there is only one in existence in
the whole world, and that that one has not been seen very
often. We are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle,
and has a brilliant golden plumage around the neck, while the
rest of the body is of a purple color; except the tail, which is
azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue; the
throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of
feathers. The first Roman who described this bird, and who
has done so with the greatest exactness, was the senator
Manilius, so famous for his learning, which he owed to the
instructions of no teacher. He tells us that no person has
ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon as
sacred to the sun, that it lives five hundred and forty years,
that when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and sprigs
of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its body
down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow
there springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time
changes into a little bird: that the first thing that it does is
to perform the obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
nest entire to the city of the Sun near Panchaia, and there
deposit it upon the altar of that divinity.</p>
<p>The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the
great year<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a> is completed with the life of this bird, and that
then a new cycle comes round again with the same characteristics
as the former one, in the seasons and the appearance of
the stars; and he says that this begins about mid-day of the
day on which the sun enters the sign of Aries. He also tells
us that when he wrote to the above effect, in the consulship
of Licinius and Cornelius, it was the two hundred and
fifteenth year of the said revolution. Cornelius Valerianus
says that the ph&oelig;nix took its flight from Arabia into Egypt
in the consulship of Plautius and Papinius. This bird was
brought to Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius,
being the eight hundredth year from the building of the City,
and it was exposed to public view in the Comitium. This
fact is attested by the public Annals, but there is no one who
supposes that it was a genuine ph&oelig;nix.</p>
<h2 id="c71"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE EAGLE.</h2>
<p>Of all the birds with which we are acquainted, the eagle is
looked upon as the most noble, and the most remarkable for
its strength. There are six different kinds; the one called
&ldquo;melanaetos&rdquo; or black eagle by the Greeks, and &ldquo;valeria&rdquo; in
our language, the least in size of them all, but the most
remarkable for its strength, is of a blackish color. It is the
only one among all the eagles that feeds its young; for the
others, as we shall presently mention, drive them away; it is
the only one too that has neither cry nor murmur; it is an
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
inhabitant of the mountains. The second kind is the pygargus
(white tail), an inhabitant of the cities and plains, and distinguished
by the whiteness of its tail. The third is the
morphnos; it is the second in size and strength, and dwells in
the vicinity of lakes. Phemono&euml;, who was styled the &ldquo;daughter
of Apollo,&rdquo; has
stated that this eagle
has teeth, but that it
has neither voice nor
tongue; she says also
that it is the blackest
of all the eagles, and
has a longer tail than
the rest; B&oelig;us is of
the same opinion.
This eagle has the
instinct to break the
shell of the tortoise
by letting it fall from
aloft, a circumstance
which caused the
death of the poet &AElig;schylus.
An oracle, it
is said, had predicted
his death on that day by the fall of a house, upon which
he took the precaution of trusting himself only under the
canopy of the heavens.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/i_p183.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="692" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">BALD, OR WHITE-HEADED EAGLE.</span>&mdash;<i>Halia&euml;tus Leucocephalus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The fourth kind of eagle is the &ldquo;percnopterus&rdquo; (black wing),
with much the appearance of the vulture, having remarkably
small wings, while the rest of the body is larger than the
others; but it is of a timid and degenerate nature, so that
even a raven can beat it. It is always famishing and ravenous,
and has a plaintive, murmuring cry. It is the only one
among the eagles that will carry off the dead carcass; the
others settle on the spot where they have killed their prey.
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
The character of this species causes the fifth one to be known
by the distinctive name of &ldquo;gnesios,&rdquo; as being the genuine
eagle, and the only one of untainted lineage; it is of moderate
size, of rather reddish color, and rarely to be met with.
The hali&aelig;tus or sea-eagle is the last, and is remarkable for its
bright and piercing eye. It poises itself aloft, and the
moment it catches sight of a fish in the sea below, pounces
headlong upon it, and cleaving the water with its breast, carries
off its prey.</p>
<p>The eagle which we have mentioned as forming the third
species, pursues the aquatic birds in the vicinity of standing
waters: in order to make their escape they plunge into the
water every now and then, until at length they are overtaken
by lassitude and sleep, upon which the eagle immediately
seizes them. The contest that takes place is really a sight
worthy to be seen. The bird makes for the shore to seek a
refuge, especially if there should happen to be a bed of reeds
there; while in the mean time the eagle endeavors to drive it
away with repeated blows of its wings, and tumbles into the
water in its attempts to seize it. While it is standing on the
shore its shadow is seen by the bird, which immediately dives
beneath, and then making its way in an opposite direction,
emerges at some point at which it thinks it is the least likely
to be looked for. This is the reason why these birds swim in
flocks, for when in large numbers they are in no danger from
the enemy; as by dashing up the spray with their wings they
blind him.</p>
<p>Again, it often happens that the eagle is not able to carry
the bird aloft on account of its weight, and in consequence
they both of them sink together. This and the hali&aelig;tus
beat their young ones while in an unfledged state, with their
wings, and force them from time to time to look steadily
upon the rays of the sun; and if the parent sees either of
them wink, or even its eye water, it throws it headlong out of
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
the nest, as being spurious and degenerate, but rears the one
whose gaze remains fixed and steady.</p>
<p>Eagles build among rocks and trees; they lay three eggs,
and generally hatch but two young ones, though occasionally
as many as three have been seen. Being weary of the
trouble of rearing both, they drive one of them from the
nest: for just at this time the providential foresight of Nature
has denied them a sufficiency of food, to save the young of
all other animals from becoming their prey. During this
period, their talons become reversed, and their feathers grow
white from continued hunger, so that it is not to be wondered
at that they take a dislike to their young. The ossifrage,
however, a kindred species, takes charge of the young ones
thus rejected, and rears them with its own; but the parent
bird still pursues them with hostility, even when grown up,
and drives them away, as being its rivals in rapine. Under
any circumstances, one pair of eagles requires a very considerable
space of ground to forage over, in order to find sufficient
sustenance; for which reason they mark out by boundaries
their respective allotments. They do not immediately
carry off their prey, but first deposit it on the ground, test its
weight and then fly away with it.</p>
<p>They die, not of old age, nor yet of sickness, or of hunger;
but the upper part of the beak grows to such an extent, and
becomes so curved, that they are unable to open it. They
take the wing, and begin upon the labors of the chase at midday;
sitting in idleness during the hours of the morning, until
such time as the places of public resort are filled with people.
It is said that this is the only bird that has never been killed
by lightning; hence usage has pronounced it to be the armor-bearer
of Jove.</p>
<p>Caius Marius, in his second consulship, assigned the eagle
exclusively to the Roman legions. Before that period it had
only held the first rank, over four others, the wolf, the minotaur,
the horse, and the wild boar, each of which preceded a
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
single division. Some few years before his time it had begun
to be the custom to carry only the eagle into battle, the other
standards being left behind in camp; but Marius abolished
the rest of them entirely. Since then, it has been remarked
that hardly ever has a Roman legion encamped for the winter,
without a pair of
eagles making their
appearance at the
spot.</p>
<p>The first two species
of eagle not only
prey upon the whole
of the smaller quadrupeds,
but will attack
even deer. Rolling in
the dust, the eagle
covers its body all
over with it, then
perching on the antlers
of the animal,
shakes the dust into
its eyes, while at the
same time it beats it
on the head with its
wings, until the creature at last precipitates itself down the
rocks. Nor is this one enemy sufficient for it; it has still
more terrible combats with the dragon, and the issue is much
more doubtful, although the battle is fought in the air. The
dragon seeks the eggs of the eagle with a mischievous
avidity; while the eagle, in return, carries it off whenever it
happens to see it; upon these occasions, the dragon coils
itself about the wings of the bird in multiplied folds, until at
last they fall to the earth together.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">MARTIAL EAGLE.</span>&mdash;<i>Spiz&aacute;&euml;tus bellicosus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>There is a very famous story about an eagle at the city of
Sestos. Having been reared by a little girl, it used to testify
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
its gratitude for her kindness, first by bringing her birds, and
in due time various other kinds of prey: at last she died, upon
which the bird threw itself on the lighted pile, and was consumed
with her body. In memory of this event, the inhabitants
raised upon the spot what they called a heroic monument,
in honor of Jupiter and the damsel, the eagle being a
bird consecrated to that divinity.</p>
<h2 id="c72"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE VULTURE AND THE HAWK.</h2>
<p>Of the vultures, the black ones are the strongest. No
person has yet found a vulture&rsquo;s nest: so that some have
thought, though erroneously, that these birds come from the
opposite hemisphere. The fact is, that they build their nest
upon the very highest rocks; their young ones are often to
be seen, generally two in number. Umbricius, the most skilful
among the aruspices of our time, says that the vulture
lays three eggs, and that with one of these it purifies the
others and its nest, and then throws it away: he states also
that they hover about for three days, over the spot where
carcasses are about to be found.</p>
<p>We find no less than sixteen kinds of hawks mentioned;
among these are the &aelig;githus, which is lame of one leg, and
is looked upon as the most favorable omen for the augurs on
the occasion of a marriage, or in matters connected with
property in the shape of cattle. There is a Roman family
that has taken its surname from the species known as the
&ldquo;buteo,&rdquo; from the circumstance of this bird having given a
favorable omen by settling upon the ship of one of them
when he held a command. The Greeks call one kind &ldquo;epileus;&rdquo;
the only one that is seen at all seasons of the year,
the others taking their departure in the winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The various kinds are distinguished by the avidity and the
various methods with which they seize their prey; for while
some will pounce on a bird only on the ground, others will
seize it only while hovering round the trees; others, again,
while it is perched aloft, and others while it is flying in mid-air.
Pigeons, on seeing them, are aware of the nature of the
danger to which they are exposed, and either settle on the
ground or else fly upwards, instinctively protecting themselves
by taking due precautions against their natural propensities.</p>
<p>In the part of Thrace which lies above Amphipolis, men
and hawks go in pursuit of prey, in a sort of partnership; for
while the men drive the birds from out of the woods and the
reed-beds, the hawks bring them down as they fly; and after
they have taken the game, the fowlers share it with them. It
has been said, that when sent aloft, they will pick out the
birds that are wanted, and that when the opportune moment
for taking them has come, they invite the fowler to seize the
opportunity by their cries and their peculiar mode of flying.
Hawks will not eat the heart of a bird. The night-hawk is
called cybindis; it is rarely found, even in the woods, and in
the day-time its sight is not good; it wages war to the death
with the eagle, and they are often to be found clasped in
each other&rsquo;s talons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/i_p189.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="761" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">GROUP OF FALCONS.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The cuckoo seems to be but another form of the hawk,<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a>
which at a certain season of the year changes its shape; it
being the fact that during this period no other hawks are to
be seen, except, perhaps, for a few days; the cuckoo itself is
only seen for a short period in the summer, and does not
make its appearance after. It is the only one among the
hawks that has not hooked talons; neither is it like the rest
of them in the head, or in any other respect, except the color,
while in the beak it bears a stronger resemblance to the
pigeon. In addition to this, it is devoured by the hawk, if
they chance at any time to meet; this being the only one
among the whole race of birds that is preyed upon by those
of its own kind. It changes its voice also with its appearance,
comes out in the spring, and goes into retirement at the
rising of the Dog-star. It always lays its eggs in the nest of
another bird,&mdash;mostly a single egg, a thing that is the case
with no other bird; sometimes however, but very rarely, it is
known to lay two. It is supposed, that the reason for its thus
substituting its young ones, is the fact that it is aware how
greatly it is hated by all the other birds;<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> for even the very
smallest of them will attack it. So, thinking that its own race
will stand no chance of being perpetuated unless it contrives
to deceive them, it builds no nest of its own: and, besides, it
is a very timid animal. In the mean time, the female bird,
sitting on her nest, is rearing a supposititous and spurious
progeny; while the young cuckoo, which is naturally craving
and greedy, snatches away all the food from the other young
ones, and by so doing grows plump and sleek, and quite
gains the affections of his foster-mother; who takes a great
pleasure in his fine appearance, and is quite surprised that
she has become the mother of so handsome an offspring.
In comparison with him, she discards her own young as so
many strangers, until at last, when the young cuckoo is now
able to take the wing, he finishes by devouring her.<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a> For
sweetness of the flesh, there is not a bird in existence to be
compared to the cuckoo at this season.</p>
<p>The kite, which belongs to the same genus, is distinguished
from the rest of the hawks by its larger size. It has been
remarked of this bird, extremely ravenous as it is, and always
craving, that it has never been known to seize any food either
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
from among funeral oblations or from the altar of Jupiter
at Olympia; nor does it ever seize any of the consecrated
viands from the hands of those who are carrying them;
except where some misfortune is presaged for the town that
is offering the sacrifice. These birds seem to have taught
man the art of steering, from the motion of the tail, Nature
pointing out by their movements in the air the method required
for navigating the deep. Kites also disappear during
the winter months, but do not take their departure before
the swallow.</p>
<h2 id="c73"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE CROW, THE RAVEN AND THE OWL.</h2>
<p>The crow, among other kinds of food, feeds upon nuts. If
these prove too hard for his beak to break, the crow flies
to a great height, and then lets them fall again and again
upon the stones and tiles beneath, until at last the shell is
cracked, and the bird is able to open them. The crow is a
bird of a very ill-omened garrulity, though it has been highly
praised by some. It is observed, that from the rising of the
constellation Arcturus until the arrival of the swallow, it is
rarely to be seen about the sacred groves and temples of
Minerva, and in Athens not at all. It is the only bird that
continues to feed its young for some time after they have
begun to fly. The crow is most inauspicious at the time of
incubation, or, in other words, just after the summer solstice.</p>
<p>All the other birds of the same kind&mdash;like the raven, for
example&mdash;drive their young ones from their nest, and compel
them to fly. In small hamlets there are never more than two
pairs to be found; and in the neighborhood of Crannon, in
Thessaly, never more than one, the parents always quitting
the spot to give place to their offspring. Ravens are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
only birds that seem to have any comprehension of the meaning
of their auspices; for when the guests of Medus were
assassinated, they all took their departure from Peloponnesus
and the region of Attica. They are of the very worst omen
when they swallow their voice, as if they were being choked.</p>
<p>The birds of the night&mdash;the owlet, the horned owl, and the
screech-owl&mdash;have crooked talons, and the sight of all is defective
in the day-time. The horned owl is especially funereal,
and is greatly abhorred in all auspices of a public nature;
it inhabits desolate spots of a frightful and inaccessible
nature: the monster of the night, its voice is heard, not with
any tuneful note, but emitting a sort of shriek. It is therefore
looked upon as a direful omen to see it in a city. I
know, however, for a fact, that it is not portentous of evil
when it settles on the top of a private house. It cannot fly
whither it wishes in a straight line, but is always carried forward
by a sidelong movement. A horned owl entered the
very sanctuary of the Capitol, in the consulship of Palpelius
and Pedanius; in consequence of which, Rome was purified
on the nones of March in that year.</p>
<p>An inauspicious bird also is that known as the &ldquo;incendiary,&rdquo;
on account of which we find in the Annals, the City has
had to be repeatedly purified; as, for instance, in the consulship
of Cassius and Marius, in which year also it was purified,
in consequence of a horned owl being seen. What kind of
bird this incendiary<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a> was, we do not find stated, nor is it
known by tradition. Some persons explain the term this
way; they say that the name &ldquo;incendiary&rdquo; was applied to
every bird that was seen carrying a burning coal from the
pyre, or altar.</p>
<p>The owlet shows considerable shrewdness in its engagements
with other birds; for when surrounded by too great a
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
number, it throws itself on its back, resists with its feet, and
rolling up its body into a mass, defends itself with the beak
and talons, until the hawk, attracted by a certain natural affinity,
comes to its assistance, and takes its share in the combat.
Nigidius says that the owlet has nine different notes.</p>
<h2 id="c74"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />THE WOODPECKER OF MARS.</h2>
<p>There are some small birds which have hooked talons; the
woodpecker, for example, surnamed &ldquo;of Mars,&rdquo; of considerable
importance in the auspices. To this kind belong the
birds which make holes in trees, and climb stealthily up them,
like cats; mounting with the head upwards, they tap against
the bark, and learn by the sound whether or not their food
lies beneath; they are the only birds that hatch their young
in the hollows of trees. It is a common belief, that if a shepherd
drives a wedge into their holes, they apply a certain
kind of herb and it immediately falls out. Trebius informs
us that if a nail or wedge is driven with ever so much force
into a tree in which these birds have made their nest, it will
instantly fly out, the tree making a loud cracking noise the
moment that the bird has lighted upon the nail or wedge.</p>
<p>These birds have held the first rank in auguries, in Latium,
since the time of the king who has given them their name.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a>
One of the presages that was given by them, I cannot pass
over in silence. A woodpecker came and lighted upon the
head of &AElig;lius Tubero, the City pr&aelig;tor, when sitting on his
tribunal dispensing justice in the Forum, and showed such
tameness as to allow itself to be taken with the hand; upon
which the augurs declared that if it was let go, the state was
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
menaced with danger, but if killed, disaster would befall the
pr&aelig;tor; in an instant he tore the bird to pieces, and before
long the omen was fulfilled.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a></p>
<p>Many birds of this kind feed also on acorns and fruit, but
only those which are not carnivorous, with the exception of
the kite; though when it feeds on anything but flesh, it is a
bird of ill omen.</p>
<p>The birds which have hooked talons are never gregarious;
each one seeks its prey by itself. They nearly all of them
soar to a great height, with the exception of the birds of the
night, and more especially those of larger size. They all have
large wings, and a small body; they walk with difficulty, and
rarely settle upon stones, being prevented from doing so by
the curved shape of their talons.</p>
<h2 id="c75"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE PEACOCK AND THE ROOSTER.</h2>
<p>We shall now speak of the second class of birds employed
in augury, which is divided into two kinds; those which give
omens by their note, and those which afford presages by their
flight. The variation of the note in the one, and the relative
size in the other, constitute the differences between them.
The peacock shall have precedence of all the rest, as much
for its singular beauty as its superior instinct, and the vanity
it displays.</p>
<p>When it hears itself praised, this bird spreads out its gorgeous
colors, especially if the sun happens to be shining at
the time, because then they are seen in all their radiance, and
to better advantage. At the same time, spreading out its
tail in the form of a shell, it throws the reflection upon the
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
other feathers, which shine all the more brilliantly when a
shadow is cast upon them; then at another moment it will
contract all the eyes depicted upon its feathers in a single
mass, manifesting great delight in having them admired by
the spectator. The peacock loses its tail every year at the
fall of the leaf, and a new one shoots forth in its place at the
flower season; between these periods the bird is abashed and
moping, and seeks retired spots. The peacock lives twenty-five
years, and begins to show its colors in the third. By
some authors it is stated that this bird is not only a vain
creature, but of a spiteful disposition, just as they attribute
bashfulness to the goose. The characteristics, however,
which they have thus ascribed to these birds, appear to me to
be utterly unfounded.</p>
<p>The orator Hortensius was the first Roman who had peacocks
killed for the table; it was on the occasion of the banquet
given by him on his inauguration in the college of the
priesthood. Marcus Aufidius Lurco was the first who taught
the art of fattening them, about the time of the last war with
the Pirates. From this source of profit he acquired an income
of sixty thousand sesterces.</p>
<p>Next after the peacock, the animal that acts as our watchman
by night, and which Nature has produced for the purpose
of arousing mortals to their labors, and dispelling their
slumbers, shows itself most actuated by feelings of vanity.
The cock knows how to distinguish the stars, and marks the
different periods of the day, every three hours, by his note.
These animals go to roost with the setting of the sun, and at
the fourth watch of the camp recall man to his cares and toils.
They do not allow the rising of the sun to creep upon us
unawares, but by their note proclaim the coming day, and
they prelude their crowing by clapping their sides with their
wings. They exercise a rigorous sway over the other birds
of their kind, and, in every place where they are kept, hold
the supreme command. This, however, is only obtained
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
after repeated battles among themselves, as they are well
aware that they have weapons on their legs, produced for that
very purpose, and the contest often ends in the death of both
the combatants at the same moment. If, on the other hand,
one of them obtains the mastery, he instantly by his note proclaims
himself the conqueror, and testifies by his crowing that
he has been victorious; while his conquered opponent silently
slinks away, and, though with a very bad grace, submits to
servitude. And with equal pride does the throng of the
poultry yard strut along, with head uplifted and crest erect.
These, too, are the only ones among the winged race that
repeatedly look up to the heavens, with the tail raised aloft,
which in its drooping shape resembles that of a sickle, and
these birds inspire terror even in the lion, the most courageous
of all animals.</p>
<p>Some of these birds, known as game-cocks, are reared for
nothing but warfare and perpetual combats, and have even
shed a lustre thereby on their native places, Rhodes and
Tanagra. The next rank is considered to belong to those of
Melos and Chalcis. Hence, it is with very good reason that
the consular purple of Rome pays these birds such singular
honors. From the feeding of these creatures the omens by
fowls are derived; they regulate day by day the movements
of our magistrates, and open or shut to them their own
houses, as the case may be; they give an impulse to the
fasces of the Roman magistracy, or withhold them; they command
battles or forbid them, and furnish auspices for victories
to be gained in every part of the world. It is these that hold
supreme rule over those who are themselves the rulers of the
earth, and whose entrails and fibres are as pleasing to the
gods as the first spoils of victory. Their note, when heard
at an unusual hour or in the evening, has also its peculiar
presages; for, on one occasion, by crowing the whole night
through for several nights, they presaged to the B&oelig;otians
that famous victory which they gained over the Laced&aelig;monians;
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
such, in fact, being the interpretation that was put
upon it by way of prognostic, as this bird, when conquered, is
never known to crow.</p>
<h2 id="c76"><span class="large">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />THE GOOSE.</h2>
<p>The goose also keeps a vigilant guard; a fact which is well
attested by the defence of the Capitol, at a moment when, by
the silence of the dogs, the commonwealth had been betrayed:
for which reason the Censors always, as their first
duty, attend to the farming-out of the feeding of the sacred
geese. One might almost be tempted to think that these
creatures have an appreciation of wisdom: for it is said, that
one of them was the constant companion of the philosopher,
Lacydes, and would never leave him, either in public or when
at the bath, by night or by day.</p>
<p>Our people, however, are more wise; for they esteem the
goose only for the excellence of its liver. When they are
crammed, this grows to a very large size, and, on being taken
from the animal, is made still larger by being soaked in honeyed
milk. It is matter of debate who first discovered so
great a delicacy; whether it was Scipio Metellus, a man of
consular dignity, or Marcus Seius, a contemporary of his,
and a Roman of equestrian rank. But there is no dispute
that it was Messalinus Cotta, the son of the orator Messala,
who first discovered the art of roasting the webbed feet of
the goose, and of cooking them in a ragout with cocks&rsquo;
combs.</p>
<p>A second income is derived from the feathers of the white
goose. In some places, this animal is plucked twice a year,
upon which the feathers quickly grow again. Those are the
softest which lie nearest to the body, and those that come
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
from Germany are the most esteemed: the geese there are
white, but of small size. The price paid for their feathers is
five denarii per pound. It is from this fruitful source that we
have repeated charges brought against the commanders of
our auxiliaries, who are in the habit of detaching whole cohorts
from the posts where they ought to be on guard, in pursuit
of these birds: indeed, we have come to such a pitch of
effeminacy, that now-a-days, not even the men can think of
lying down without the aid of the goose&rsquo;s feathers, by way of
pillow.</p>
<h2 id="c77"><span class="large">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />CRANES.</h2>
<p>The tracts over which the cranes travel must be immense,
if we only consider that they come all the way from the Eastern
Sea. These birds agree by common consent at what
moment they shall set out, fly aloft to look out afar, select a
leader for them to follow, and have sentinels duly posted in
the rear, which relieve each other by turns, utter loud cries,
and with their voice keep the whole flight in proper array.
During the night, they place sentinels on guard, each of
whom holds a little stone in its claw: if the bird should happen
to fall asleep, the claw becomes relaxed, and the stone
falls to the ground, and so convicts it of neglect. The rest
sleep in the mean while, with the head beneath the wing,
standing first on one leg and then on the other: the leader
looks out, with neck erect, and gives warning when required.
These birds, when tamed, are very frolicsome, and even when
alone will describe a sort of circle, as they move along, with
their clumsy gait.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact, that these birds, when about to fly
over the Euxine, first of all repair to the narrowest part of it,
that lies between the two Promontories of Criumetopon and
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
Carambis, and then ballast themselves with coarse sand.
When they have arrived midway in the passage, they throw
away the stones from out of their claws, and, as soon as they
reach the mainland, discharge the sand from the throat.</p>
<p>Cornelius Nepos, who died in the reign of the late Emperor
Augustus, after stating that thrushes had been fattened for
the first time shortly before that period, has added that storks
were more esteemed as food than cranes; but at the present
day, this last bird is one of those that are held in the very
highest esteem, while no one will touch the other.</p>
<h2 id="c78"><span class="large">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />STORKS AND SWANS.</h2>
<p>Up to the present time it has not been ascertained from
what place the storks come, or whither they go when they
leave us. There can be no doubt but that, like the cranes,
they come from a very great distance, the cranes being our
winter, the storks our summer, guests. When about to take
their departure, the storks assemble at a stated place, and are
particularly careful that all shall attend, so that not one of
their kind may be left behind, with the exception of such as
may be in captivity or tamed; and then on a certain day they
set out, as though they were by some law directed to do so.
No one has ever yet seen a flight of cranes taking their departure,
although they have been often observed preparing to
depart; and in the same way, too, we never see them arrive.
Both their departure and their arrival take place in the night.
In some of the vast plains of Asia, they assemble together,
keep up a gabbling noise, and tear to pieces the one that happens
to arrive the last; after which they take their departure.
After the middle of August, they are never by any accident
to be seen there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Some writers assure us that the stork has no tongue. So
highly are they esteemed for their utility in destroying serpents,
that in Thessaly, it was a capital crime for any one to
kill a stork, and by the laws the same penalty was inflicted
for it as for homicide.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/i_p200.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="747" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">STORK.</span>&mdash;<i>Ciconia Alba.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Geese and swans
travel in a similar manner,
but are seen to
take their flight. The
flocks, forming a point
like a harrow, much
after the manner of our
Liburnian beaked galleys,
move along with
great impetus, being
thus able to cleave the
air more easily than if
they presented to it a
broad front. The flight
gradually enlarges in
the rear, in the form
of a wedge, presenting
a vast surface to the
breeze, as it impels
them onward; those that follow place their necks on those
that go before, while the leading birds, as they become weary,
fall to the rear. Storks return to their former nests, and the
young, in their turn, support their parents when old. It is
stated that at the moment of the swan&rsquo;s death, it gives utterance
to a mournful song;<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a> but this is an error, in my opinion.
These birds will eat the flesh of one another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c79"><span class="large">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH VISIT US.</h2>
<p>Having spoken of the emigration of these birds over sea
and land, I cannot allow myself to defer mentioning some
other birds of smaller size, which have the same natural
instinct: although in the case of those which I have already
mentioned, their very size and strength would almost
seem to invite them to such habits. The quail, which always
arrives among us before the crane, is a small bird, which more
commonly keeps to the ground than flies aloft. These birds
fly in a similar manner to those I have already spoken of, and
not without considerable danger to mariners, when they come
near the surface of the earth: for it often happens that they
settle on the sails of a ship, and that, too, always in the night,
in such numbers that the vessel often sinks. These birds
pursue their course along a tract of country with certain resting-places.
When the south wind is blowing, they will not
fly, as that wind is always humid, and apt to weigh them
down, the body being so light, and their strength so very limited:
and frequently we hear them make a murmuring noise
as they fly, it being extorted from them by fatigue. For this
reason they take to flight when the north wind is blowing,
having the ortygometra<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a> for their leader. The first of them
that approaches the earth is generally snapped up by the
hawk. When they are about to return from these parts, they
always invite other birds to join their company, and the glottis,
otus, and cychramus, yielding to their persuasions, take
their departure along with them.</p>
<p>The glottis protrudes a tongue of remarkable length, from
which circumstance it derives its name: at first it is quite
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
pleased with the journey, and sets out with the greatest
ardor; but very soon, when it begins to feel the fatigues of
the flight, it is overtaken by regret, while at the same time it
is equally as loth to return alone, as to accompany the others.
Its travels never last more than a single day, for at the very
first resting-place they come to, it deserts: here, too, it finds
other birds, which have been left behind in a similar manner
in the preceding year. The same takes place with other
birds day after day. The cychramus is much more persevering,
and is in such a hurry to arrive at the land which is its
destination, that it arouses the quails in the night, and reminds
them that they ought to be on the road.</p>
<p>The otus is a smaller bird than the horned owl, though
larger than the owlet; it has feathers projecting like ears,
which gives it its name. Some persons call it in the Latin
language the &ldquo;asio;&rdquo; in general it is a bird fond of mimicking,
a great parasite, and, in some measure, a dancer as well.
Like the owlet, it is taken without any difficulty: for while
one person occupies its attention, another goes behind, and
catches it.</p>
<p>If the wind, by its contrary blasts, should begin to prevent
the onward progress of the flight, the birds immediately take
up small stones, or else fill their throats with sand, and so
contrive to ballast themselves as they fly. The seeds of a
certain venomous plant<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> are most highly esteemed by the
quails as food; for which reason they have been banished
from our tables; and a great repugnance is manifested to eating
their flesh, on account of the epilepsy, to which alone of
all animals, with the exception of man, the quail is subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<h2 id="c80"><span class="large">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />SWALLOWS.</h2>
<p>The swallow, the only bird that is carnivorous among those
which have not hooked talons, takes its departure also during
the winter months; but it goes only to neighboring countries,
seeking sunny retreats there on the mountain sides; sometimes
they have been found in such spots bare and quite unfledged.
This bird, it is said, will not enter a house in
Thebes, because that city has been captured so frequently;
nor will it approach the country of the Bizy&aelig;, on account of
the crimes committed there by Tereus. C&aelig;cina, a member
of the equestrian order, and the owner of several chariots,
used to have swallows caught, and then carried them with
him to Rome. Upon gaining a victory, he would send the
news by them to his friends; for after staining them the color
of the party that had gained the day, he would let them go,
immediately upon which they would make their way to the
nests they had previously occupied. Fabius Pictor also relates,
in his Annals, that when a Roman garrison was being
besieged by the Ligurians, a swallow which had been taken
from its young ones was brought to him, in order that he
might give them notice, by the number of knots on a string
tied to its leg, on what day succor would arrive, and a sortie
might be made with advantage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c81"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />BIRDS WHICH TAKE THEIR DEPARTURE FROM US IN WINTER.</h2>
<p>In a similar manner also, the blackbird, the thrush, and the
starling take their departure to neighboring countries; but
they do not lose their feathers, nor conceal themselves, as
they are often to be seen in places where they seek their food
during the winter: hence it is that in winter, more especially,
the thrush is so often to be seen in Germany. It is, however,
a well-ascertained fact, that the turtle-dove conceals itself, and
loses its feathers. The ring-dove, also, takes its departure,
yet it is a matter of doubt whither they go. A peculiarity of
the starling is to fly in troops, as it were, and then to wheel
round in a globular mass like a ball, the central troop acting
as a pivot for the rest. Swallows are the only birds that have
a sinuous flight of remarkable velocity; so that they are not
exposed to the attacks of other birds of prey: these are the
only birds that take their food solely on the wing.</p>
<p>The time during which birds show themselves differs very
considerably. Some, like the pigeon, remain with us all the
year round, some for six months, such as the swallow; and
some again, for three months only, as the thrush, the turtledove,
and those which take their departure the moment they
have reared their young, like the witwall and the hoopoe.</p>
<p>There are some authors who say that every year certain
birds fly from &AElig;thiopia to Ilium, and have a combat at the
tomb of Memnon there; from which circumstance they have
received from them the name of Memnonides, or birds of
Memnon. Cremutius states it also as a fact, ascertained by
himself, that they do the same every fifth year in &AElig;thiopia,
around the palace of Memnon.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, the birds called meleagrides fight in
B&oelig;otia. They are a species of African poultry, having a
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
hump on the back covered with a mottled plumage. These
are the latest among the foreign birds that have been received
at our tables, on account of their disagreeable smell.
The tomb, however, of Meleager has rendered them famous.</p>
<p>Those birds are called seleucides, which are sent by Jupiter
at the prayers offered up to him by the inhabitants of Mount
Casius, when the locusts are ravaging their crops of corn.
Whence they come, or whither they go, has never yet been
ascertained, as, in fact, they are never to be seen but when
the people stand in need of their aid.</p>
<p>The Egyptians also invoke their ibis against the incursions
of serpents; and the people of Elis, their god Myiagros (the
hunter of flies), when the vast multitudes of flies are bringing
pestilence among them; the flies die immediately after the
propitiatory sacrifice has been made to this god.</p>
<p>Rhodes possesses no eagles. In Italy beyond the Padus,
there is, near the Alps, a lake known by the name of Larius,
beautifully situated amid a country covered with shrubs; and
yet this lake is never visited by storks, nor are they ever
known to come within eight miles of it; while in the neighboring
territory of the Insubres there are immense flocks of
magpies and jackdaws, the only bird that is guilty of stealing
gold and silver, a very singular propensity.</p>
<p>It is said that in the territory of Tarentum, the woodpecker
of Mars is never found. It is only lately, and that very
rarely, that various kinds of pies have begun to be seen in
the districts that lie between the Apennines and the City.
These birds are remarkable for the length of the tail and for
the peculiarity of becoming bald every year at the time of
sewing rape. The partridge does not fly beyond the frontiers
of B&oelig;otia, into Attica; nor does any bird, in the island
in the Black Sea in which Achilles was buried, enter the
temple there consecrated to him. In the territory of Fiden&aelig;,
in the vicinity of the City, the storks have no young nor do
they build nests: but vast numbers of ringdoves arrive from
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
beyond sea every year in the district of Volaterr&aelig;. At
Rome, neither Hies nor dogs ever enter the temple of Hercules
in the Cattle Market. There are numerous other
instances of a similar nature in reference to all kinds of animals,
which from time to time I feel myself prompted by
prudent considerations to omit, lest I should only weary the
reader.</p>
<p>There is another remarkable fact, too, relative to the birds
which give omens by their note; they generally change their
color and voice at a certain season of the year, and suddenly
become quite altered in appearance; a thing that, among the
larger birds, happens with the crane only, which grows black
in its old age. From black, the blackbird changes to a reddish
color, sings in summer, chatters in winter, and about the
summer solstice loses its voice; when a year old, the beak
also assumes the appearance of ivory; but only in the case of
the male. In summer, the thrush is mottled about the neck,
but in winter it becomes of one uniform color all over.</p>
<h2 id="c82"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />THE NIGHTINGALE.</h2>
<p>The song of the nightingale is to be heard, without intermission,
for fifteen days and nights, continuously, when the
foliage is thickening, as it bursts from the bud; a bird which
deserves our admiration in no slight degree. First of all,
what a powerful voice it has in so small a body! its note, how
long, and how well sustained! And then, too, it is the only
bird the notes of which are modulated in accordance with the
strict rules of musical science. At one moment, as it sustains
its breath, it will prolong its note, and then at another, will
vary it with different inflections; then, again, it will break into
distinct chirrups, or pour forth an endless series of roulades.
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
Then it will warble to itself, while taking breath, or disguise
its voice in an instant; while sometimes, again, it will twitter
to itself, now with a full note, now with a grave, now again
sharp, now with a broken note, and now with a prolonged
one. Sometimes, when it thinks fit, it will break out into
quavers, and will run through, in succession, alto, tenor, and
bass: in a word, in so tiny a throat is to be found all the
melody that the ingenuity of man has ever discovered
through the medium of the invention of the most exquisite
flute: so, that there can be no doubt it was an infallible presage
of his future sweetness as a poet, when one of these
creatures perched and sang on the infant lips of the poet
Stesichorus.</p>
<p>No doubt there is a remarkable degree of art in its performances,
for every individual has a number of notes peculiar
to itself; they do not, all of them, have the same, but each,
certain melodies of its own. They vie with one another, and
the spirit with which they contend is evident to all. Often the
one that is vanquished, dies in the contest, preferring to yield
its life rather than its song. The younger birds are listening,
in the mean time, and receive the lesson in song from which
they are to profit. The learner hearkens with the greatest
attention, and repeats what it has heard, and then they are
silent by turns; this is understood to be the correction of an
error on the part of the scholar, and a sort of reproof, as it
were, on the part of the teacher. Nightingales bring as high
a price as slaves, and sometimes more than used formerly to
be paid for a man in a suit of armor.</p>
<p>I know that on one occasion six thousand sesterces ($250)
was paid for a nightingale, a white one it is true, a thing that
is hardly ever to be seen, for a present to Agrippina, the wife
of the Emperor Claudius. A nightingale has been often seen
that will sing at command, and take alternate parts with the
music that accompanies it; men, too, have been found who
could imitate its note with such exactness, that it would be
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
impossible to tell the difference, by merely putting water in a
reed held crosswise, and then blowing into it, a languette being
first inserted, for the purpose of breaking the sound and
rendering it more shrill. But these modulations, so clever
and so artistic, begin gradually to cease at the end of the fifteen
days; not that you can say, however, that the bird is
either fatigued or tired of singing; but, as the heat increases,
its voice becomes altogether changed, and possesses no longer
either modulation or variety of note. Its color, too, becomes
changed, and at last, throughout the winter, it totally disappears.
The tongue of the nightingale is not pointed at the
tip, as in other birds. It lays at the beginning of the spring,
six eggs at the most.</p>
<h2 id="c83"><span class="large">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />THE HALCYONS: THE HALCYON DAYS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO NAVIGATION.</h2>
<p>This bird is a little larger than a sparrow, and the greater
part of its body is of an azure blue color, with a slight intermixture
of white and purple in some of the larger feathers,
while the neck is long and slender. There is one kind that is
remarkable for its larger size and its note; the smaller ones
are heard singing in the reed-beds. It is a thing of very rare
occurrence to see a halcyon, and then it is only about the
time of the setting of the Vergili&aelig;, and the summer and
winter solstices; when one is sometimes to be seen to hover
about a ship, and then immediately disappear. They hatch
their young at the time of the winter solstice, from which
circumstance those days are known as the &ldquo;halcyon days:&rdquo;
during this period the sea is calm and navigable, the Sicilian
sea in particular. They make their nest during the seven
days before the winter solstice, and sit the same number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
days after. Their nests are truly wonderful;<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> they are of
the shape of a ball slightly elongated, have a very narrow
mouth, and bear a strong resemblance to a large sponge. It
is impossible to cut them asunder with iron, and they are
only to be broken with a strong blow, upon which they separate,
just like foam of the sea when dried up. It has never
yet been discovered of what material they are made; some
persons think that they are formed of sharp fish-bones, as it
is on fish that these birds live. They enter rivers also; their
eggs are five in number.</p>
<p>The sea-mew builds its nest in rocks, and the diver in trees
as well.</p>
<h2 id="c84"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />THE INSTINCTIVE CLEVERNESS DISPLAYED BY BIRDS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR NESTS.</h2>
<p>The form of the nest built by the halcyon reminds me also
of the instinctive cleverness displayed by other birds; and, in
no respect is the ingenuity of birds more deserving of our
admiration. The swallow builds its nest of mud, and
strengthens it with straws. If mud happens to fail, it soaks
itself with a quantity of water, which it then shakes from off
its feathers into the dust. It lines the inside of the nest with
soft feathers and wool, to keep the eggs warm, and in order
that the nest may not be hard and rough to its young when
hatched. It divides the food among its offspring with the
most rigid justice, giving it first to one and then to another.</p>
<p>There is a kind of swallow that frequents the fields and the
country; its nest is of a different shape, though of the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
materials, but it rarely builds it against houses. The nest
has its mouth turned straight upwards, and the entrance to it
is long and narrow, while the body is very capacious. It is
quite wonderful what skill is displayed in the formation of it,
for the purpose of concealing the young ones, and of presenting
a soft surface for them to lie upon. At the Heracleotic
Mouth of the Nile in Egypt, the swallows present an insuperable
obstacle to the inroads of that river, in the embankment
which is formed by their nests in one continuous line,
nearly a stadium in length; a thing that could not possibly
have been effected by the agency of man. In Egypt, near
the city of Coptos, there is an island sacred to Isis. In the
early days of spring, the swallows strengthen the angular corner
of this island with chaff and straw, thus fortifying it in
order that the river may not sweep it away. This work they
persevere in for three days and nights together, with such
unremitting labor, that many of them die with their exertions.</p>
<p>A third kind of swallow makes holes in the banks of rivers,
to serve for its nest. The young of these birds, reduced to
ashes, are a good specific against mortal maladies of the
throat, and tend to cure many other diseases of the human
body. These birds do not build nests, and they take care to
migrate a good many days before, if it so happens that the
rise of the river is about to reach their holes.</p>

<br />THE ACANTHYLLIS AND THE PARTRIDGE.</h2>
<p>Belonging to the genus of birds known as the &ldquo;vitiparr&aelig;,&rdquo;
there is one whose nest is formed of dried moss,<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a> and is in
shape so exactly like a ball, that it is impossible to discover
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
the mouth of it. The bird known as the acanthyllis, makes
its nest of a similar shape, and interweaves it with pieces of
flax. The nest of one of the woodpeckers, very much like a
cup in shape, is suspended by a twig from the end of the
branch of a tree, so that no quadruped may be able to reach
it. It is strongly asserted, that the witwall sleeps suspended
by its feet, because it fancies that by doing so it is in greater
safety. In a spirit of foresight, they select projecting
branches of trees that are sufficiently strong, for the purpose
of supporting their nests, and then arch them over to protect
them from the rain, or else shield them by means of the
thickness of the foliage.</p>
<p>In Arabia there is a bird known as the &ldquo;cinnamolgus,&rdquo;
which builds its nest with sprigs of cinnamon; the natives
knock the nests down with arrows loaded with lead, in
order to sell them. In Scythia there is a bird, the size of the
otis, which produces two young ones always, in a hare&rsquo;s skin
suspended from the top branches of a tree. Pies, when they
have observed a person steadily gazing at their nest, will immediately
remove their eggs to another place. This is
accomplished in a truly wonderful manner, by such birds as
have not toes adapted for holding and removing their eggs.
They lay a twig upon two eggs, and then solder them to it by
means of a glutinous matter secreted from their body; after
which, they pass their neck between the eggs, and so forming
an equipoise, convey them to another place.</p>
<p>No less shrewdness is displayed by those birds which make
their nests upon the ground, because, from the extreme
weight of their body, they are unable to fly aloft. There is a
bird, known as the &ldquo;merops,&rdquo; which feeds its parents in their
retreat: the color of the plumage is pale on the inside, and
azure without, while it is of a somewhat reddish hue at the
extremity of the wings: this bird builds its nest in a hole
which it digs to the depth of six feet.</p>
<p>Partridges fortify their retreat so well with thorns and
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
shrubs, that it is effectually protected against beasts of prey.
They make a soft bed for their eggs by burying them in the
dust, but do not hatch them where they are laid: that no suspicion
may arise from the fact of their being seen repeatedly
about the same spot, they carry them away to some other
place. The females also conceal themselves in order that
they may not be delayed in the process of incubation, as the
males are apt to break the eggs. The males often fall to
fighting among themselves like game-cocks, and through this
very pugnacity, these birds are often taken, as the leader of
the whole covey frequently advances to fight with the decoy-bird
of the fowler; as soon as he is taken, another and then
another will advance, all of which are caught in their turn.</p>
<p>These birds are often carried away by such frantic madness,
that they will settle, being quite blinded by fear, upon the
very head of the fowler. If he happens to move in the direction
of the nest, the female bird that is sitting will run and
throw herself before his feet, pretending to be wounded or
weak, then, suddenly running or flying for a short distance
before him, will fall down as though she had a wing broken;
just as he is about to catch her, she will then take another fly,
and so keep baffling him in his hopes, until she has led him
to a considerable distance from her nest. As soon as she is
rid of her fears, and free from all maternal disquietude, she
will throw herself on her back in some furrow, and seizing a
clod of earth with her claws, cover herself all over. It is supposed
that the life of the partridge extends to sixteen years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c86"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />PIGEONS.</h2>
<p>The pigeon will never desert its nest, unless it is either
widower or widow. They manifest a great degree of affection
for their offspring. When the female is sitting, the male
renders her every attention that can in any way tend to her
solace and comfort. The first thing that they do is to eject
from the throat some saltish earth, which they have digested,
into the mouths of the young ones, in order to prepare them
in due time to receive their nutriment. It is a peculiarity of
the pigeon and of the turtle-dove, not to throw back the neck
when drinking, but to take in the water at a long draught,
just as beasts of burden do.</p>
<p>We read in some authors that the ring-dove lives as long as
thirty years, and sometimes forty, without any other inconvenience
than the extreme length of the claws, which with
them is the chief mark of old age; they can be cut, however,
without any danger. The voice of all these birds is similar,
being composed of three notes, succeeded by a mournful
noise at the end. In winter they are silent, recovering their
voice with coming of the spring. Nigidius expresses the
opinion that the ring-dove will abandon the place, if she hears
her name mentioned under the roof where she is sitting on
her eggs: they hatch their young at the summer solstice.
Pigeons and turtle-doves live eight years. The sparrow, on
the other hand, is short-lived in the extreme. Pigeons appear
to have a certain appreciation of glory. They are well aware
of the colors of their plumage, and the various shades which
it presents, and even in their very mode of flying they court
our applause, as they cleave the air in every direction.
Through this spirit of ostentation they are handed over, fast
bound as it were, to the hawk; for from the flapping of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
wings, their long feathers become twisted and disordered;
while if they can fly without any impediment, they are far
swifter in their movements than the hawk. The robber,
lurking amid the dense foliage, keeps on the look-out for
them, and seizes them at the very moment that they are
indulging their vain-glorious self-complaisance.</p>
<p>For this reason it is necessary to keep along with the pigeons
the bird that is known as the &ldquo;tinnunculus;&rdquo; as it protects
them, and by its natural superiority scares away the
hawk. The hawk will vanish at the very sight of it, or the
instant it hears its voice. Pigeons have a special regard for
this bird; and, it is said, if one of these birds is buried at
each of the four corners of the pigeon-house in pots that have
been newly glazed, the pigeons will not change their abode&mdash;a result
which has been obtained by some keepers of pigeons,
by cutting a joint of their wings with an instrument of gold;
for if any other were used, the wounds would be attended
with danger.&mdash;The pigeon in general may be looked upon as
a bird fond of change; they have the art, too, among themselves
of gaining one another over, and so proselyting companions:
we frequently find them returning to the cote attended
by others which they have enticed away.</p>
<p>Pigeons have frequently acted as messengers in affairs of
importance. During the siege of Mutina, Decimus Brutus,
who was in the town, sent despatches to the camp of the consuls
fastened to pigeons&rsquo; feet. Of what use to Antony then
were his intrenchments, and all the vigilance of the besieging
army? or his nets, which he had spread in the river, while the
messenger of the besieged was cleaving the air?</p>
<p>Many persons have a mania for pigeons&mdash;building towns
for them on the top of their roofs, and taking a pleasure in relating
the pedigree and noble origin of each. Of this there is
an ancient instance which is very remarkable; Lucius Axius,
a Roman of the equestrian order, shortly before the Civil
War of Pompey, sold a single pair for four hundred denarii,
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
so Marcus Varro tells us. Countries even have gained renown
for their pigeons; it is thought that those of Campania
attain the largest size.</p>
<h2 id="c87"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br />DIFFERENT MODES OF FLIGHT AND PROGRESSION IN BIRDS.</h2>
<p>Mentioning the flight of the pigeon leads me to consider
that of other birds. All other animals have one determinate
mode of progression, which in every kind is always the same;
birds alone have two modes of moving&mdash;on the ground,
and in the air. Some of them walk, such as the crow, for
instance; some hop, as the sparrow and the blackbird; some
run, as the partridge and the woodhen; while others throw
one foot before the other, like the stork and the crane. Then
again, in their flight, some birds expand their wings, and poising
themselves in the air, only move them from time to time;
others move them more frequently, but then only at the extremities;
while others expand them so as to expose the
whole of the side. On the other hand, some fly with the
greater part of the wings kept close to the side; and some,
after striking the air once, others twice, make their way
through it, as though pressing upon it enclosed beneath their
wings; other birds dart aloft in a vertical direction, others
horizontally, and others come falling straight downwards.
You would almost think that some had been hurled upwards
with a violent effort, and that others had fallen straight down
from aloft; while others still are seen to spring forward in
their flight. Ducks alone, and the other birds of that kind,
in an instant raise themselves aloft, taking a spring from the
spot where they stand straight upwards towards the heavens;
and this they can do directly from the water. They are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
only birds that can make their escape from the pitfalls which
we employ for the capture of wild beasts.</p>
<p>The vulture and the heavier wild birds can only fly after
taking a run, or else by commencing their flight from an elevated
spot. They use the tail by way of rudder. There are
some birds that are able to see all around them; others have
to turn the neck to do so. Some of them eat what they have
seized, holding it in their feet. Many, as they fly, utter some
cry, while others are always silent. Some fly with the breast
half upright, others with it held downwards, others fly obliquely,
or side-ways, and others follow the direction of the
bill. The fact is, that if we were to see several kinds at the
same moment, we should not suppose that they were adapted
to the same element.</p>
<p>Those birds which are known as &ldquo;apodes&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a> fly the most
of all, because they are deprived of the use of their feet.
They are a species of swallow which build their nests in the
rocks, and are the same birds that are to be seen everywhere
at sea. However far a ship may go, however long its voyage,
and however great the distance from land, the apodes
never cease to hover around it. Other birds settle and rest,
but these know no repose save in the nest; they are always
either on the wing or asleep.</p>
<h2 id="c88"><span class="large">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br />STRANGE AND FABULOUS BIRDS.</h2>
<p>The instincts of birds are no less varied in relation to their
food. The &ldquo;Caprimulgus,&rdquo; or goat-milker, is the name of a
bird, which is to all appearance a large blackbird; it thieves
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
by night, as it cannot see during the day. It enters the folds
of the shepherds, and makes straight for the udder of the she-goat,
to suck the milk. Through the injury thus inflicted the
udder shrivels away, and the goat that has been thus deprived
of its milk, is afflicted with incipient blindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Platea,&rdquo; or spoon-bill, is the name of another, which
pounces upon other birds when they have dived in the sea,
and, seizing the head with its bill, makes them let go their
prey. This bird will swallow and fill itself with shell-fish,
shells and all, and after the natural heat of its crop has softened
them, it will bring
them up again, pick out
the shells from the rest,
and choose the parts
that are fit for food.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">SPOTTED KING FISHER.</span>&mdash;<i>C&eacute;ryle Gutt&aacute;ta.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The farm-yard fowls
have a certain notion
of religion; upon laying
an egg they shudder all over,
and then
shake their feathers;
after which they turn
round and purify<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> themselves, or else hallow<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> themselves
and their eggs with some stalk or other. The carduelis,
which is the very smallest bird of any, will do what it is bid,
not only with the voice but with the feet as well, and with the
beak, which serves it instead of hands. There is one small
bird, found in the territory of Arelate, that imitates the lowing
of oxen, from which circumstance it has received the
name of &ldquo;taurus.&rdquo; Another, called the anthus, imitates the
neighing of the horse; upon being driven from the pasture by
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
the approach of the horses, it will mimic their voices&mdash;taking
this method of revenging itself.</p>
<p>But remarkable as it may seem, there are some birds that
can imitate the human voice; the parrot, for instance, can
even converse. India sends us this bird, which it calls by the
name of &ldquo;sittaces;&rdquo; the body is green all over, except a ring
of red around the neck. It will formally salute an emperor,
and pronounce the words it has heard spoken; it is rendered
especially frolicsome under the influence of wine. Its head is
as hard as its beak;
and this, when it is being
taught to talk, is
beaten with a rod of
iron, for otherwise it
is quite insensible to
blows. When it lights
on the ground it falls
upon its beak, and by
resting upon it makes
itself all the lighter
for its feet, which are
naturally weak.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">RHINOCEROS HORNBILL.</span>&mdash;<i>B&uacute;ceros Rhinoceros.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The magpie is much
less famous for its talking
qualities than the
parrot, because it does
not come from a distance,
and yet it can
speak with much more distinctness. These birds love to hear
words spoken which they can utter; and not only do they
learn them, but are pleased at the task; and as they con
them over to themselves with the greatest care and attention,
make no secret of the interest they feel. It is a well-known
fact, that a magpie has died before now, when it has found itself
mastered by a difficult word that it could not pronounce.
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
Their memory, however, will fail them if they do not from
time to time hear the same word repeated; and while they
are trying to recollect it, they will show the most extravagant
joy, if they happen to hear it. Their appearance, although
there is nothing remarkable in it, is by no means plain; but
they have quite enough in the way of attractions in their singular
ability to imitate human speech.</p>
<p>Only that kind of pie<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> which feeds upon acorns can be
taught to speak; and among these, those which have five
toes on each foot<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> can be taught with the greatest facility;
but even in their case only during the first two years of their
life. The magpie has a broad tongue, as do all the birds that
can imitate the human voice; although some individuals of
almost every kind have the faculty of doing so.</p>
<p>Agrippina, the wife of Claudius C&aelig;sar, had a thrush that
could imitate human speech, a thing that was never known
before. At the moment that I am writing this, the young
C&aelig;sars<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> have a starling and some nightingales that are being
taught to talk in Greek and Latin; besides which, they are
studying their task the whole day, continually repeating the
new words that they have learnt, and giving utterance to
phrases of considerable length. Birds are taught to talk in a
retired spot, where no other voice can be heard, so as to interfere
with their lesson; a person sits by them, and continually
repeats the words he wishes them to learn, while at the
same time he encourages them by giving them food.</p>
<p>Let us do justice to the raven, whose merits have been attested
not only by the kindlier sentiments of the Roman people,
but also by the strong expression of their indignation.
In the reign of Tiberius, one of a brood of ravens that had
bred on the top of the temple of Castor, happened to fly into
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
a shoemaker&rsquo;s shop that stood opposite: upon which, from a
feeling of religious veneration, it was looked upon as doubly
recommended by the owner of the place. The bird, having
been taught to speak at an early age, used every morning to
fly to the Rostra, which look towards the Forum; here, addressing
each by his name, it would salute Tiberius, and then
the C&aelig;sars<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> Germanicus and Drusus, after which it would
proceed to greet the Roman populace as they passed, and
then return to the shop: for several years it was remarkable
for the constancy of its attendance. The owner of another
shoemaker&rsquo;s shop in the neighborhood, in a sudden fit of
anger killed the bird, enraged, as he would have had it appear,
because it had soiled some shoes of his. Upon this,
such rage was manifested by the multitude, that he was at
once driven from that part of the city, and soon after put to
death. The funeral, too, of the bird was celebrated with
almost endless obsequies; the body was placed upon a litter
carried upon the shoulders of two &AElig;thiopians, preceded by a
piper, and borne to the pile with garlands of every size and
description. The pile was erected on the right-hand side of
the Appian Way, at the second milestone from the City, in
the field generally known as the &ldquo;field of Rediculus.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a> Thus
did the rare talent of a bird appear a sufficient ground to the
Roman people for honoring it with funeral obsequies, as well
as for inflicting punishment on a Roman citizen. No such
crowds ever escorted the funeral of any one out of the whole
number of its distinguished men.</p>
<p>At the present day, there is in the city of Rome a crow
which belongs to a Roman of equestrian rank, and was
brought from B&aelig;tica. It is remarkable for its color, which is
of the deepest black, and is able to pronounce several connected
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
words, while repeatedly learning fresh ones. Recently,
too, there has been a story told about Craterus of
Erizena in Asia, who was in the habit of hunting with the
assistance of ravens, and used to carry them into the woods,
perched on the tuft of his helmet and on his shoulders. The
birds used to keep on the watch for game, and raise it; and
by training he had brought this art to such a pitch of perfection,
that even the wild ravens would attend him in a similar
manner when he went out. Some authors have thought the
following circumstance deserving of remembrance:&mdash;A crow
that was thirsty was seen heaping stones into the urn on a
monument, in which there was some rain-water which it could
not reach: by thus accumulating the stones, it raised the level
of the water till it came within its reach.</p>
<p>I must not pass by the birds of Diomedes in silence. Juba
calls them &ldquo;cataract&aelig;,&rdquo; and says that they have teeth and
eyes of a fiery color, while the rest of the body is white: they
always have two chiefs, the one to lead the main body, the
other to take charge of the rear, they excavate holes with
their bills, and then cover them with hurdles, which they
cover again with the earth that has been thus thrown up; in
these places they hatch their young; each of these holes has
two outlets&mdash;one of them looking towards the east, by which
they go forth to feed, returning by the one which looks towards
the west. In one only spot throughout the whole earth
are these birds to be seen&mdash;in the island which is famous for
the tomb and shrine of Diomedes, lying over against the
coast of Apulia: they bear a strong resemblance to the coot.
When strangers who are barbarians arrive on that island, they
pursue them with loud and clamorous cries, and only show
courtesy to Greeks by birth; seeming thereby, with a wonderful
discernment, to pay respect to them as the fellow-countrymen
of Diomedes. Every day they fill their throats,
and cover their feathers, with water, and so wash and purify
the temple there. From this circumstance arises the fable
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
that the companions of Diomedes were metamorphosed into
these birds.</p>
<p>We ought not to omit, while we are speaking of instincts,
that among birds the
swallow<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a> is quite incapable
of being taught,
and among land animals
the mouse; while
on the other hand, the
elephant does what it
is ordered, the lion submits
to the yoke, and
the sea-calf and many
kinds of fishes are capable
of being tamed.</p>
<p>Birds drink by suction;
those which have
a long neck taking
their drink in a succession
of draughts, and
throwing the head
back, as though they
were pouring the water
down the throat. The
porphyrio is the only
bird that seems to bite
at the water as it
drinks. The same bird
has also other peculiarities of its own; for it will every now
and then dip its food in the water, and then lift it with its
foot to its bill, using it as a hand. Those that are the most
esteemed are found in Commagene. They have beaks and
very long red legs.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">KING PENGUIN.</span>&mdash;<i>Aptenodytes Pennantii.</i></p>
</div>
<p>All the heavy birds are frugivorous; while those with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
higher flight feed upon flesh only. Among the aquatic birds,
the divers are in the habit of devouring what the other
birds have disgorged.</p>
<p>The pelican is similar in appearance to the swan, and nobody
would imagine there was any difference between them,
were it not for the fact that under the throat there is a sort of
second crop. In this the ever-insatiate animal stows everything
away, till the capacity of this pouch is quite astonishing.
Having finished its search for prey, it discharges bit by bit
what it has thus stowed away, and reconveys it by a sort of
ruminating process into its real stomach. The part of Gallia
that lies nearest to the Northern Ocean produces this bird.</p>
<p>We hear of a singular kind of bird in the Hercynian Forest,
in Germany, the feathers of which shine at night like
fire; the other birds there have nothing remarkable beyond
the celebrity which generally attaches to objects situated at a
distance.</p>
<p>During the civil wars that took place at Bebriacum, beyond
the river Padus, the &ldquo;new birds&rdquo; were introduced into Italy&mdash;for
by that name they are still known. They resemble the
thrush in appearance, are a little smaller than the pigeon in
size, and of an agreeable flavor. The Balearic islands also
send us a porphyrio or flamingo, as well as the buteo, a kind
of hawk, held in high esteem for the table, and the vipio, the
name given to a small kind of crane.</p>
<p>I look upon the birds as fabulous which are called &ldquo;pegasi,&rdquo;
and are said to have a horse&rsquo;s head; as also the griffons, with
long ears and a hooked beak. The same is my opinion, also,
as to the tragopan; many writers, however, assert that it is
larger than the eagle, has curved horns on the temples, and a
plumage of iron color, with the exception of the head, which
is purple. Nor do the sirens obtain any greater credit with
me, although Dinon, the father of Clearchus, a celebrated
writer, asserts that they exist in India, and that they charm
men by their song, and, having first lulled them to sleep, tear
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
them to pieces. The person, however, who may think fit to
believe in these tales, may probably not refuse to believe also
that dragons licked the ears of Melampodes, and bestowed
upon him the power of understanding the language of birds;
or what Democritus says, when he gives the names of certain
birds, by the mixture of whose blood a serpent is produced,
the person who eats of which will be able to understand the
language of birds; as well as the statements which the same
writer makes relative to one bird in particular, known as the
&ldquo;galerita,&rdquo; or crested lark&mdash;indeed, the science of augury is
already too much involved in embarrassing questions, without
these fanciful reveries.</p>
<h2 id="c89"><span class="large">CHAPTER XXI.</span>
<br />THE ART OF CRAMMING POULTRY.&mdash;AVIARIES.</h2>
<p>The people of Delos were the first to cram poultry, and to
originate that abominable mania for devouring fattened birds,
larded with the grease of their own bodies. I find in the
ancient sumptuary regulations as to banquets, that this was
forbidden for the first time by a law of the consul Caius Fannius,
eleven years before the Third Punic War; by which it
was ordered that no bird should be served at table beyond a
single pullet, and that not fattened; an article which has since
made its appearance in all the sumptuary laws. A method,
however, has been devised of evading it, by feeding poultry
upon food that has been soaked in milk: prepared in this
fashion, they are considered still more delicate. Not all
pullets are looked upon as equally good for the purposes of
fattening, but only those are selected which have a fatty skin
about the neck. Then come all the arts and affectations of
the kitchen&mdash;that the thighs may have a nice plump appearance,
that the bird may be properly divided down the back,
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
and that poultry may be brought to such a size that a single
leg shall fill a whole platter. The Parthians have taught their
fashions to our cooks; yet after all, in spite of their refinements
in luxury, no article is found to please equally in
every part, for in one it is the thigh, and in another the breast
that is esteemed.</p>
<p>The first person who invented aviaries for the reception of
all kinds of birds was Marcus L&aelig;nius Strabo, a member of
the equestrian order, who resided at Brundisium. In his time
we thus began to imprison animals to which Nature had assigned
the heavens as their element.</p>
<p>But more remarkable than anything else in this respect, is
the story of the dish of Clodius &AElig;sopus, the tragic actor,
which was valued at one hundred thousand sesterces, and in
which were served up nothing but birds that had been remarkable
for their song, or their imitation of the human voice, and
he purchased each of them at the price of six thousand sesterces,
being induced to this folly by no other pleasure than
that in these he might eat the closest imitators of man; never
for a moment reflecting that his own immense fortune had
been acquired by the advantages of his voice; a parent right
worthy of the son of whom we have already made mention as
swallowing pearls. It would not be very easy to decide which
of the two was guilty of the greatest baseness, unless, indeed,
we admit that it was less unseemly to banquet upon the most
costly of all the productions of Nature, than to devour tongues
which had given utterance to the language of man.</p>

<br />PECULIARITIES OF ANIMALS.</h2>
<p>The salamander, an animal like a lizard in shape, and with
a body starred all over, never comes out except during heavy
showers, and disappears the moment it becomes fine. This
animal is so intensely cold as to extinguish fire by its contact,
in the same way as ice
does. It spits forth a
milky matter from its
mouth; and from whatever
part of the human
body is touched with
this, all the hair falls
off, and the part assumes
the appearance
of leprosy.</p>

</div>
<p>Man excels most in
his sense of touch, and next in that sense of taste.
In other respects, he is surpassed by many of the animals.
Eagles can see more clearly than any other animals, while
vultures have the better smell; moles hear more distinctly
than others, although buried in the earth, so dense and
sluggish an element as it is; and though every sound has a
tendency upwards, they can hear the words that are spoken;
and, it is said, that if you talk about them, they will take to
flight immediately. Among men, a person who has not enjoyed
the sense of hearing in his infancy, is deprived of the
powers of speech as well. Among the marine animals, it is
not probable that oysters enjoy the sense of hearing, but it is
said that the instant a noise is made the solen will sink to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
bottom; for this reason silence is observed by persons while
fishing at sea.</p>
<p>Fish have neither organs of hearing, nor the exterior orifice.
And yet, it is quite certain that they do hear; for it is a well-known
fact, that in some fish-ponds they are in the habit of
being assembled to be fed by the clapping of the hands. In
the fish-ponds, too, that belong to the Emperor, the fish are
in the habit of coming, each kind as it hears its name. So
the mullet, the wolf-fish, the salpa, and the chromis, have a
very exquisite sense of hearing, and for this reason they frequent
shallow water.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/i_p227.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="364" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">HEMIGALE</span>&mdash;<i>Hemigale Hardwickii.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It is quite manifest
that fish have also the
sense of smell; for they
are not all to be taken
with the same bait, and
are seen to smell at it
before they seize it.
Some, too, that are concealed
in the bottom of
holes, are driven out by
the fisherman, by the aid of the smell of salted fish; with this
he rubs the entrance of their retreat in the rock, immediately
upon which they take to flight from the spot, as though they
had recognized the dead carcasses of those of their kind.
Then they will rise to the surface at the smell of certain
odors, such, for instance, as roasted s&aelig;pia and polypus; these
baits are placed in the osier kipes used for taking fish. They
immediately take to flight upon smelling the bilge water in
a ship&rsquo;s hold, and especially upon scenting the blood of fish.</p>
<p>The polypus cannot possibly be torn away from the rock to
which it clings; but, apply the herb cunila, and the instant it
smells it the fish quits its hold. Purples also are taken by
means of fetid substances. As to the other kinds of animals,
who is there that can feel any doubt that they possess the
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
sense of smell? Serpents are driven away by the smell of
harts&rsquo; horns, and ants are killed by the odors of origanum,
lime, or sulphur. Gnats are attracted by acids, but not by
anything sweet.</p>
<p>All animals have the sense of touch, even those which have
no other sense; in the oyster and the worm, this sense is
found.</p>
<p>I am strongly inclined to believe, too, that the sense of
taste exists in all animals; for why else should one seek one
kind of food, and another another? In this is to be seen the
wondrous power of Nature, the framer of all things. Some
animals seize their prey with their teeth, others with their
claws; some tear it to pieces with their hooked beak; others,
that have a broad bill, wabble in their food; others, with a
sharp nib, work holes into it; others suck at their food, lick it,
sup it in, chew it, or bolt it whole. And no less a diversity is
there in the uses they make of their feet, for the purpose of
carrying, tearing asunder, holding, squeezing, suspending their
bodies, or incessantly scratching the ground.</p>
<p>Serpents will feed on eggs, and the address displayed by
the dragon is quite remarkable. For it will either swallow
the egg whole, if its jaws will allow of it, and roll over and
over so as to break it within, and then by coughing eject
the shells: or else, if it is too young to be able to do so, it
will gradually encircle the egg with its coils, and hold it so
tight as to break it at the end, just, in fact, as though a piece
had been cut out with a knife; then holding the remaining
part in its folds, it will suck the contents.</p>
<p>Scorpions live on earth. Serpents, when an opportunity
presents itself, show an especial liking for wine, although in
other respects they need but very little drink. These animals,
when kept shut up, require but little aliment, hardly any at
all, in fact. The same is the case also with spiders, which at
other times live by suction. No venomous animal will die of
hunger or thirst. The sphingium and the satyr stow away
food in the pouches of their cheeks, after which they will take
it out piece by piece with their hands and eat it; thus they do
for a day or an hour what the ant usually does for the whole
year.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>The only animal with toes upon the feet that feeds upon
grass is the hare, and he will eat corn as well; while the solid-hoofed
animals, and the swine among the cloven-footed ones,
will eat all kinds of food, as well as roots. To roll over and
over is a peculiarity of the animals with a solid hoof. All
those which have serrated
teeth are carnivorous.
Bears live
also upon corn, leaves,
grapes, fruit, bees,
crabs and ants; wolves
will eat earth even
when they are famishing.
Cattle grow fat
by drinking; hence salt
agrees with them well.
All animals ruminate
lying in preference to
standing, and more in winter than in summer. The Pontic
mouse also ruminates in a similar manner.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">

<p class="caption"><span class="small">THE CAT</span>&mdash;<i>Felis Dom&eacute;stica.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In drinking, those animals which have serrated or canine
teeth, lap; and common mice do the same, although they belong
to another class. Those which have the teeth continuous,
horses and oxen, for instance, sup; bears do neither the
one nor the other, but seem to bite at the water, and so devour
it. In Africa, the greater part of the wild beasts do not
drink in summer, through the want of rain; the mice of Libya,
when caught, will die if they drink. The ever-thirsting plains
of Africa produce the oryx, an animal which, in consequence
of the nature of its native locality, never drinks, and which, in
a remarkable manner, affords a remedy against drought: for
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
the G&aelig;tulian bandits by its aid fortify themselves against
thirst, by finding in its body certain vesicles filled with a
most wholesome liquid. In this same Africa, also, the pards
conceal themselves in the thick foliage of the trees, and then
spring down from the branches on any creature that may
happen to be passing by, thus occupying what are ordinarily
the haunts of the birds. With what silent stealthiness, with
what light steps do the cats creep towards a bird! How slily
they will sit and watch, and then dart out upon a mouse!</p>

<br />THE VARIOUS KINDS OF INSECTS.</h2>
<h2 id="c91"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />THE EXTREME SMALLNESS OF INSECTS.</h2>
<p>We shall now proceed to a description of insects, a subject
replete with endless difficulties. Insects are numerous, and
form many species, and their mode of life is like that of the
terrestrial animals and the birds. Some, like bees, are furnished
with wings; others are divided into those kinds which
have wings, and those which are without them, such as ants;
while others, again, are destitute of both wings and feet. All
these animals have been very properly called &ldquo;insects,&rdquo; from
the incisures or divisions which separate the body, sometimes
at the neck, and sometimes at the corselet, and so divide it
into members or segments, only united to each other by a
slender tube. In some insects, however, this division is not
complete, as it is surrounded by wrinkled folds; and the flexible
vertebrae of the creature, whether situate at the abdomen,
or whether only at the upper part of the body, are protected
by layers, overlapping each other; indeed, in no one of her
works has Nature more fully displayed her exhaustless ingenuity.</p>
<p>In large animals, on the other hand, or, at all events, in the
very largest among them, she found her task easy and her
materials ready and pliable; but in these minute creatures, so
nearly akin as they are to nonentity, how surpassing the intelligence,
how vast the resources, and how ineffable the perfection
which she has displayed. Where is it that she has
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
united so many senses as in the gnat?&mdash;not to speak of
creatures that might be mentioned of still smaller size&mdash;Where,
I say, has she found room to place in it the organs of
sight? Where has she centred the sense of taste? Where
has she inserted the power of smell? And where, too, has
she implanted that sharp shrill voice of the creature, so utterly
disproportioned to the smallness of its body? With what astonishing
subtlety has she united the wings to the trunk,
elongated the joints of the legs, framed that long craving
concavity for a belly, and then inflamed the animal with an
insatiate thirst for blood, that of man especially! What ingenuity
has she displayed in providing it with a sting,<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a> so
well adapted for piercing the skin! And then too, just as
though she had had the most extensive field for the exercise
of her skill, although the weapon is so minute that it can
hardly be seen, she has formed it with a twofold mechanism,
providing it with a point for the purpose of piercing, and at
the same moment making it hollow, to adapt it for suction.</p>
<p>What teeth, too, has she inserted in the teredo, to adapt it
for piercing even oak with a sound which fully attests their
destructive power! while at the same time she has made wood
its principal nutriment. We willingly yield our admiration to
the shoulders of the elephant as they support the turret, to
the stalwart neck of the bull, and the might with which it
hurls aloft whatever comes in its way, to the onslaught of the
tiger, or to the mane of the lion; while at the same time,
Nature is nowhere to be seen to greater perfection than in
the very smallest of her works. For this reason then, I must
beg of my readers, notwithstanding the contempt they feel for
many of these objects, not to feel a similar disdain for the information
I am about to give relative thereto, seeing that, in
the study of Nature, there are none of her works that are unworthy
of our consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c92"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />WHETHER INSECTS BREATHE, AND WHETHER THEY HAVE BLOOD.</h2>
<p>Many authors deny that insects breathe, upon the ground
that in their viscera there is no respiratory organ<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a> to be
found. They assert that insects have the same kind of life as
plants and trees, there being a very great difference between
respiring and merely having life. On similar grounds also,
they assert that insects have no blood, a thing which cannot
exist, they say, in any animal that is destitute of heart and
liver; just as, according to them, those creatures cannot
breathe which have no lungs. Upon these points, however, a
vast number of questions will naturally arise; for the same
writers do not hesitate to deny that these creatures are destitute
also of voice,<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a> and this, notwithstanding the humming of
bees, the chirping of grasshoppers, and the sounds emitted by
numerous other insects which will be considered in their respective
places. For my part, whenever I have considered the
subject, I have ever felt persuaded that there is nothing impossible
to Nature, nor do I see why creatures should be less
able to live and yet not inhale, than to respire without being
possessed of viscera, a doctrine which I have already maintained,
when speaking of the marine animals; and that, notwithstanding
the density and the vast depth of the water which
would appear to impede all breathing. But what person
could very easily believe that there can be any creatures that
fly to and fro, and live in the very midst of the element of respiration,
while, at the same time, they themselves are devoid
of that respiration; that they can be possessed of the requisite
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
instincts for nourishment, working, and making provision
even for time to come, in the enjoyment too of the powers of
hearing, smelling, and tasting, as well as those other precious
gifts of Nature, address, courage, and skilfulness? That these
creatures have no blood I am ready to admit, just as all the
terrestrial animals are not possessed of it; but they have
something similar, by way of equivalent.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a></p>
<p>Insects, so far as I find myself able to ascertain, seem to
have neither sinews,<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> bones, spines, cartilages, fat, nor flesh;
nor yet so much as a frail shell, like some of the marine animals,
nor even anything that can with any propriety be termed
skin; but they have a body which is of a kind of intermediate
nature between all these, of an arid substance, softer than
muscle, and in other respects of a nature that may, in strictness,
be rather pronounced yielding, than hard. Such, then,
is all that they are, and nothing more: in the inside of their
bodies there is nothing, except in a few, which have an intestine
arranged in folds. Hence, even when cut asunder, they
are remarkable for their tenacity of life, and the palpitations
which are to be seen in each of their parts. For every portion
of them is possessed of its own vital principle, which is
centred in no limb in particular, but in every part of the
body; least of all, however, in the head, which alone is subject
to no movements unless torn off together with the corselet.
No kind of animal has more feet than the insects have,
and those which have the most, live the longest when cut
asunder, as we see in the case of the scolopendra. They
have eyes, as well the senses of touch and taste; some of
them have also the sense of smelling, and a few that of hearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c93"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />BEES.</h2>
<p>But among them all, the first rank, and our special admiration,
ought, in justice, to be accorded to bees, which alone,
of all the insects, appear to have been created for the benefit
of man. They extract honey and collect it, a juicy substance
remarkable for its extreme sweetness, lightness, and wholesomeness.
They form their combs and collect wax, an article
that is useful for a thousand purposes of life; they are patient
of fatigue, toil at their labors, form themselves into political
communities, hold councils together in private, elect chiefs in
common, and, a thing that is the most remarkable of all, have
their own code of morals. In addition to this, being as they
are neither tame nor wild, so all-powerful is Nature, that,
from a creature so minute as to be nothing more hardly than
the shadow of an animal, she has created a marvel beyond
all comparison. What muscular power, what exertion of
strength are we to put in comparison with such vast energy
and industry as theirs? What display of human genius, in a
word, shall we compare with the reasoning powers manifested
by them? In this they have, at all events, the advantage of
us&mdash;they know of nothing but what is for the common benefit
of all. Away, then, with all questions whether they breathe
or no, and let us be ready to agree on the question of their
blood.&mdash;And now let us form some idea of the instinct they
display.</p>
<p>Bees keep within the hive during the winter&mdash;for whence
are they to derive the strength requisite to withstand frosts
and snows, and the northern blasts? The same, in fact, is
done by all insects, but not to so late a period; as those
which conceal themselves in the walls of our houses are much
sooner sensible of the returning warmth. With reference to
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
bees, either seasons and climates have considerably changed,
or else former writers have been greatly mistaken. They retire for
the winter at the setting of the Vergili&aelig;, and remain
shut up till after the rising of that constellation, well past the
beginning of spring. They do not come forth to ply their
labors until the bean blossoms; but then not a day do they
lose in inactivity, while the weather is favorable for their pursuits.</p>
<p>First of all, they set about constructing their combs, and
forming the wax, or, in other words, making their dwellings
and cells; after this they produce their eggs and then make
honey and wax from flowers, and extract bee-glue from the
tears of those trees which distil glutinous substances, the
juices, gums, and resins, namely, of the willow, the elm, and
the reed. With these substances, as well as others of a more
bitter nature, they first line the whole inside of the hive, as a
sort of protection against the greedy propensities of other
small insects, as they are well aware that they are about to
form that which will prove an object of attraction to them.
Having done this, they employ similar substances in narrowing
the entrance to the hive, if otherwise too wide.</p>
<p>The bees also form collections of &ldquo;bee-bread&rdquo; to serve as
the food of the bees while they are at work, and is often
found stowed away in the cavities of the cells, being of a
bitter flavor. It is produced from the spring dews and the
gummy juices of trees, being less abundant while the south-west
wind is blowing, and blackened by the prevalence of a
south wind. Sometimes it is of a reddish color and becomes
improved by the north-east wind; it is found in the greatest
abundance upon the nut trees in Greece.</p>
<p>Bees form wax from the blossoms of almost all trees and
plants. Where olives are in the greatest abundance, the
swarms of bees are the most numerous. Bees are not injurious
to fruit of any kind; they will never settle on a dead
flower, much less a dead carcass. They pursue their labors
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
within three-score paces of their hives; and when the flowers
in their vicinity are exhausted, they send out scouts from time
to time, to discover places for forage at a greater distance.
When overtaken by night in their expeditions, they watch till
the morning, lying on their backs, in order to protect their
wings from the action of the dew.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that there have been persons who have
made bees their exclusive study; Aristomachus of Soli, for
instance, who for a period of fifty-eight years did nothing
else; Philiscus of Thasos, also, surnamed Agrius, who passed
his life in desert spots, tending swarms of bees. Both of
these have written works on this subject.</p>
<h2 id="c94"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE MODE IN WHICH BEES WORK.</h2>
<p>The manner in which bees carry on their work is as follows.
In the day time a guard is stationed at the entrance of the
hive, like the sentries in a camp. At night they take their
rest until one of them awakes the others in the morning with
a humming noise, repeated twice or thrice, just as though it
were sounding a trumpet. They then take their flight in a
body, if the day is likely to turn out fine; for they have the
gift of foreknowing wind and rain, and in such case will keep
close within their dwellings. On the other hand, in fine
weather the swarm issues forth, and at once applies itself to
its work, some loading their legs from the flowers, while
others fill their mouths with water, and charge the downy
surface of their bodies with drops of liquid. Those among
them that are young go forth to their labors, and collect
the materials already mentioned, while those that are more
aged stay within the hives and work. The bees whose business
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
it is to carry the flowers use their fore feet to load their
thighs, which Nature has made rough for the purpose, and
with their trunks load their fore feet: bending beneath their
load, they then return to the hive, where there are three
or four bees ready to receive them and aid in discharging
their burdens. For, within the hive as well, they have their
allotted duties to perform: some are engaged in building,
others in smoothing the combs, while others again are occupied
in passing on the materials, and others in preparing food
from the provision which has been brought; that there may
be no unequal division, either in their labor, their food, or the
distribution of their time, they do not even feed separately.</p>
<p>Commencing at the vaulted roof of the hive, they begin the
construction of their cells, and, just as we do in the manufacture
of a web, they construct their cells from top to bottom,
taking care to leave two passages around each compartment,
for the entrance of some and the exit of others. The combs,
which are fastened to the hive in the upper part, and in a
slight degree also at the sides, adhere to each other, and are
thus suspended altogether. They do not touch the floor of
the hive, and are either angular or round, according to its
shape; sometimes, in fact, they are both angular and round
at once, when two swarms are living in unison, but have
dissimilar modes of operation. They prop up the combs that
are likely to fall, by means of arched pillars, at intervals
springing from the floor, so as to leave them a passage for the
purpose of effecting repairs. The first three ranks of their
cells are generally left empty when constructed; and the last
ones, especially, are filled with honey: hence the combs are
always taken out at the back of the hive.</p>
<p>The bees that are employed in carrying look out for a
favorable breeze, and if a gale should happen to spring up,
they poise themselves in the air with little stones, by way of
ballast; some writers say that they place them upon their
shoulders. When the wind is contrary, they fly close to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
ground, taking care, however, to keep clear of the brambles.
It is wonderful what strict watch is kept upon their work: all
instances of idleness are carefully remarked, the offenders are
chastised, and on a repetition of the fault, punished with
death. Their sense of cleanliness, too, is quite extraordinary;
everything is removed that might be in the way, and the rubbish
and waste bits made by those that are at work within, is
all collected into one spot, and on stormy days, when they are
obliged to cease their ordinary labors, they employ themselves
in carrying it out. Towards evening, the buzzing in
the hive becomes gradually less and less, until at last one of
their number is to be seen flying about the hive with the
same loud humming noise with which they were aroused in
the morning, thereby giving the signal, as it were, to retire to
rest: in this, too, they imitate the usage of the camp. The
moment the signal is heard, all is silent.</p>
<p>They first construct the dwellings of the commonalty, then
those of the king-bee. If they have reason to expect an
abundant<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> season, they add abodes also for the drones: these
are cells of a smaller size, though the drones themselves are
larger than the bees.</p>
<p>The drones have no sting, and would seem to be a kind of
imperfect bee, formed the very last of all; a late and tardy
offspring, and doomed, in a measure, to be the slaves of the
genuine bees. The others exercise over them a rigorous
authority, compel them to take the foremost rank in their
labors, and if they show any sluggishness, punish them<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a>
without mercy. When the honey is beginning to come to
maturity, the bees drive away the drones, and setting upon
each in great numbers, put them all to death. It is only in
the spring that the drones are ever to be seen. If you
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
deprive a drone of its wings, and then replace it in the hive, it
will pull off the wings of the other drones.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the hive they construct for their future
sovereign a palatial abode, spacious and grand, separated from
the rest, and surmounted by a sort of dome: if this prominence
should happen to be flattened, all hopes of progeny are
lost. All the cells are hexagonal. No part of this work is
done at any stated time, as the bees seize every opportunity
for the performance of their task when the days are fine; in
one or two days, at most, they fill their cells with honey.</p>
<p>The honey is always best in those countries where it is to
be found deposited in the calix of the most exquisite flowers,
such, for instance, as the districts of Hymettus in Attica, and
Hybla in Sicily, and after them the island of Calydna. At
first, honey is thin, like water, after which it effervesces for
some days, and purifies itself like must. On the twentieth
day it begins to thicken, and soon after becomes covered with
a thin membrane, which gradually increases through the scum
which is thrown up by the heat. The honey of the very
finest flavor, and the least tainted by the leaves of trees,
is that gathered from the foliage of the oak and the linden,
and from reeds.</p>
<p>In some countries we find the honey-comb remarkable for
the goodness of the wax, as in Sicily and the country of the
Peligni; in other places the honey itself is found in greater
abundance, as in Crete, Cyprus, and Africa; and in others,
again, the comb is remarkable for its size; in Germany a
comb has been known to be as much as eight feet in length.</p>
<p>In taking the combs the greatest care is always requisite,
for the bees become desperate when stinted for food, and
either pine to death, or wing their flight to other places: on
the other hand, over-abundance will entail idleness, and they
will feed upon the honey, and not the bee bread. The most
careful breeders take care to leave the bees a fifteenth part of
this gathering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>The crop of honey is most abundant if gathered at full
moon, and is richest when the weather is fine. The summer
honey is the most esteemed of all, from the fact of its being
made when the weather is dryest: it is best when made from
thyme; it is then of a golden color, and of a most delicious
flavor. Thyme honey does not coagulate, and on being
touched will draw out into thin viscous threads, the proof of
its heaviness. When honey shows no tenacity, and the drops
immediately part from one another, it is looked upon as a
sign of its worthlessness.</p>
<h2 id="c95"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE BEES.</h2>
<p>Let a man employ himself, forsooth, in the enquiry whether
there has been only one Hercules, how many Bacchuses there
have been, and all the other questions which are buried deep
in the mould of antiquity! Here behold a tiny object, one to
be met with at most of our country retreats, and numbers of
which are always at hand, and yet, after all, it is not agreed
among authors whether or not the king<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> is the only one
among them that is provided with no sting, and is possessed
of no other arms than those afforded him by his majestic office,
or whether Nature has granted him a sting, and has only denied
him the power of making use of it; it being a well-known
fact, that the ruling bee never does use a sting. The obedience
which his subjects manifest in his presence is quite surprising.
When he goes forth, the whole swarm attends him,
throngs about him, surrounds him, protects him, and will not
allow him to be seen. At other times, when the swarm is at
work within, the king is seen to visit the works, and appears
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
to be giving his encouragement, being himself the only one
that is exempt from work: around him are certain other bees
which act as body-guards and lictors, the careful guardians of
his authority. The king never quits the hive except when
the swarm is about to depart; a thing which may be known a
long time beforehand, as for some days a peculiar buzzing
noise is to be heard within, which denotes that the bees are
waiting for a favorable day, and making all due preparations
for their departure. On such an occasion, if care is taken to
deprive the king of one of his wings, the swarm will not fly
away. When they are on the wing, every one is anxious to
be near him, and takes a pleasure in being seen in the performance
of its duty. When he is weary, they support him
on their shoulders; and when he is quite tired, they carry
him outright. If one of them falls in the rear from weariness,
or happens to go astray, it is able to follow the others by the
aid of its acuteness of smell. Wherever the king bee happens
to settle, that becomes the encampment of all.</p>
<p>Happy omens are sometimes afforded by the swarming of
bees, clustering, as they do, like a bunch of grapes, upon
houses or temples; presages often of great events. Bees
settled upon the lips of Plato when still an infant, announcing
thereby the sweetness of that persuasive eloquence for which
he was so noted. Bees settled in the camp of the chieftain
Drusus when he gained the brilliant victory at Arbalo; a
proof that the conjectures of soothsayers are not by any
means infallible, for they consider this always of evil augury.
When their leader is withheld from them, the swarm can
always be detained; when lost, it will disperse and take its
departure to find other kings. Without a king, they cannot
exist.</p>
<p>If food fail the inhabitants of any particular hive, the swarm
makes a concerted attack upon a neighboring one, with the
view of plundering it. The swarm attacked at once ranges
itself in battle array, and if the bee-keeper should happen to
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
be present, that side which perceives itself favored by him
will refrain from attacking him. They often fight, for other
reasons, and the two generals are to be seen drawing up their
ranks in battle array against their opponents. The battle is
immediately ended by throwing dust among them, or raising
a smoke; and if milk or honey mixed with water is placed before
them, they speedily become reconciled.</p>
<h2 id="c96"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />WASPS AND HORNETS.</h2>
<p>Wasps build their nests of mud in lofty places, and make
wax: hornets, on the other hand, build in holes or in the hollows
of trees. With these two kinds the cells are also hexagonal,
but, in other respects, though made of the bark of
trees, they strongly resemble the substance of a spider&rsquo;s web.
Their young are found at irregular intervals, and are of unshapely
appearance; while one is able to fly, another is still a
mere pupa, and a third only in the maggot state. The wasp
which is known as the ichneumon, a smaller kind than the
others, kills one kind of spider in particular, known as the
phalangium; after which it carries the body to its nest, covers
it over with a sort of gluey substance, and then sits and
hatches from it its young.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> In addition to this, they are all
of them carnivorous, while bees will touch no animal substance
whatever. Wasps particularly pursue the larger flies, and after
catching them cut off the head and carry away the remaining
portion of the body.</p>
<p>Wild hornets live in the holes of trees, and in winter, like
other insects, keep themselves concealed; their life does not
exceed two years in length. Not unfrequently, their sting is
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
productive of an attack of fever, and there are authors who
say that thrice nine stings will suffice to kill a man. In spring
they build their nests, generally with four entrances, and here
the working hornets are produced: after these have been
hatched they form other nests of larger size. These races,
too, have their drones. Neither hornets nor wasps have a
king, nor do they ever congregate in swarms.</p>
<h2 id="c97"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />THE SILK-WORM.</h2>
<p>Another class of insects spring from a grub of larger size,
with two horns of very peculiar appearance. The larva becomes
a caterpillar, after which it assumes the state in which
it is known as <i>bombylis</i>, then that called <i>necydalus</i>, and in six
months it becomes a silk-worm. These insects weave webs
similar to those of the spider, the material of which is used
for making the more costly and luxurious garments of ladies,
known as &ldquo;bombycina.&rdquo; Pamphile, a woman of Cos, the
daughter of Platea, was the first person who discovered the
art of unravelling these webs and spinning a tissue therefrom.</p>
<p>The silk-worm is said to be a native of the isle of Cos,
where the vapors of the earth give new life to the flowers of
the cypress, the terebinth, the ash, and the oak which have
been beaten down by the showers. At first they assume the
appearance of small butterflies with naked bodies, but soon
after, being unable to endure the cold, they throw out bristly
hairs, and assume quite a thick coat against the winter, rubbing
off the down that covers the leaves, by the aid of the
roughness of their feet. This they compress into balls by
carding it with their claws, and then draw it out and hang it
between the branches of the trees, making it fine by combing
it out: last of all, they take and roll it round their body, thus
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
forming a nest in which they are enveloped. In this state
they are taken; after which they are placed in earthen vessels
in a warm place, and fed upon bran. A peculiar sort of
down soon shoots forth upon the body, on being clothed with
which they are set to work upon another task. The cocoons
which they have begun to form are rendered soft and pliable
by the aid of water, and are then drawn out into threads by
means of a spindle made of a reed. Even men have not felt
ashamed to make use of garments formed of this material, in
consequence of their extreme lightness in summer: for, so
greatly have manners degenerated in our day, that, so far
from wearing a cuirass, a thin garment is found to be too
heavy.</p>
<h2 id="c98"><span class="large">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />SPIDERS.</h2>
<p>It is by no means an absurdity to append to the silk-worm
an account of the spider&mdash;a creature worthy of our special
admiration. The <i>phalangium</i> is of small size, with body
spotted and running to a point; their bite is venomous, and
they leap as they move from place to place. Another kind
is black, with fore legs remarkable for their length. They
have all of them three joints in the legs. The smaller kind
of wolf-spider does not make a web, but the larger ones make
holes in the earth, and spread their nets at the narrow entrance.
A third kind is remarkable for the skill which it displays
in its operations. These spin a large web, the creature
having in itself a certain faculty of secreting a peculiar
sort of woolly substance. How steadily does it work with its
claws, how beautifully rounded and how equal are the threads
as it forms its web, while it employs the weight of its body as
an equipoise! It begins at the middle to weave its web, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
then extends it by adding the threads in rings around, like a
warp upon the woof: forming the meshes at equal intervals,
but continually enlarging them as the web increases in
breadth, it finally unites them all by an indissoluble knot.
With what wondrous art does it conceal the snares that lie in
wait for its prey in its checkered nettings! How loose is the
body of the web as it yields to the blasts, and how readily
does it catch all objects which come in its way! You would
fancy that it had left, quite exhausted, the thrums of the
upper portion of its net unfinished where they are spread
across; for with the greatest difficulty can they be perceived,
and yet the moment that an object touches them, like the
lines of the hunter&rsquo;s net, they throw it into the body of the
web. With what architectural skill, too, is its hole arched
over, and how well defended by a nap of extra thickness
against the cold! How carefully it retires into a corner, and
appears intent upon something else, all the while keeping so
carefully shut up from view, that it is impossible to perceive
whether there is anything within or not! And then, how
extraordinary the strength of the web! When is the wind
ever known to break it, or what accumulation of dust is able
to weigh it down?</p>
<p>The spider often spreads its web right across between two
trees, the thread extending from the very top of the tree to
the ground, while the insect springs up again in an instant
from the earth, and travels aloft by the self-same thread, thus
mounting at the same moment and spinning its threads.
When its prey falls into its net, how on the alert it is, and
with what readiness it runs to seize it! Even though it
should be adhering to the very edge of its web, the insect
always runs instantly to the middle, where it can most effectually
shake the web, and so successfully entangle its prey.
When the web is torn, the spider immediately sets about repairing
it, and that so neatly, that nothing like patching can
ever be seen. The spider lies in wait even for the young of
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
the lizard, and after enveloping the head of the animal, bites
its lips; a sight by no means unworthy of the amphitheatre
itself, when it is one&rsquo;s good fortune to witness it. Presages
also are drawn from the spider; for when a river is about to
swell, it will suspend its web higher than usual. As these
insects spin not in calm weather, but when it is cloudy, a great
number of cobwebs is a sure sign of showery weather. It is
generally supposed that the female spider spins while the
male lies in wait for prey, thus making an equal division of
their duties.</p>
<h2 id="c99"><span class="large">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />LOCUSTS.</h2>
<p>Locusts lay their eggs in large masses, in the autumn, in
holes which they form in the ground. These eggs remain
underground throughout the winter, and in the ensuing year,
at the close of spring, small locusts issue from them, of a
black color. A wet spring destroys their eggs, while, if it is
dry, they multiply in great abundance.</p>
<p>Locusts are produced only in champaign places, that are
full of chinks and crannies. In India, it is said that they attain
the length of three<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a> feet, and that the people dry the
legs and thighs, and use them for saws. Sometimes the winds
carry off these creatures in vast swarms, upon which they fall
into the sea or standing waters, and perish. Some authors
have stated, that they are unable to fly during the night, in
consequence of the cold, being ignorant of the fact that they
travel over lengthened tracts of sea for many days together,
a thing the more to be wondered at, as they have to endure
hunger all the time as well, for this it is which causes them
to be thus seeking pastures in other lands. Such a visitation
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
is looked upon as a plague inflicted by the anger of the gods;
for as they fly they appear to be larger than they really are,
while they make such a loud noise with their wings, that they
might be readily supposed to be winged creatures of quite another
species. Their numbers, too, are so vast, that they quite
darken the sun; while the people below are anxiously following
them with the eye, to see if they are about to make a
descent, and so cover their lands. After all, they have the
requisite energies for their flight; and, as though it had been
but a trifling matter to pass over the seas, they cross immense
tracts of country, and cover them in clouds which bode destruction
to the harvests. Scorching numerous objects by
their very contact, they eat away everything with their teeth,
even the very doors of the houses.</p>
<p>Those from Africa are the ones which chiefly devastate
Italy; and more than once the Roman people have been
obliged to have recourse to the Sibylline Books, to learn
what remedies to employ under their existing apprehensions
of impending famine. In the territory of Cyrenaica<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a> there is
a law, which even compels the people to make war, three
times a year, against the locusts, first, by crushing their eggs,
next by killing the young, and last of all by killing those of
full growth; and he who fails to do so, incurs the penalty of
being treated as a deserter. In the island of Lemnos also,
there is a certain measure fixed by law, which each individual
is bound to fill with locusts which he has killed, and then
bring it to the magistrates. They pay great respect to the
jack-daw, which flies to meet the locusts, and kills them in
great numbers. In Syria, the people are placed under martial
law, and compelled to kill them: in so many countries does
this dreadful pest prevail. The Parthians look upon them as
a choice food, and the grasshopper as well. The voice of the
locust appears to proceed from the back part of the head.
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
It is generally believed that in this place, where the shoulders
join on to the body, they have, as it were, a kind of teeth, and
by grinding these against each other they produce the harsh
noise which they make. About the two equinoxes they
are to be heard in the same way that we hear the chirrup of
the grasshopper about the summer solstice. In all these
kinds of insects the male is of smaller size than the female.</p>
<h2 id="c100"><span class="large">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />ANTS.</h2>
<p>Ants work in common, like bees; but while the latter make
their food, the former only store it away. If a person compares
the burdens which the ants carry with the size of their
bodies, he must confess that there is no animal which, in proportion,
is possessed of a greater degree of strength. They
carry these burdens with the mouth, or, when it is too large to
admit of that, they turn their backs to it, and push it onwards
with their feet, while they use their utmost energies with their
shoulders. These insects have a political community among
themselves, and are possessed of both memory and foresight.
They gnaw each grain before they lay it by, for fear lest it
should shoot while under ground; they divide those grains
which are too large for admission, at the entrance of their
holes; and those which have become soaked by the rain, they
bring out and dry.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a> They work, too, by night, during the
full moon. What ardor they display in their labors, what
wondrous carefulness! Because they collect their stores
from different quarters, in ignorance of the proceedings of
one another, they have certain days set apart for holding a
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
kind of market, on which they meet together and take stock.
What vast throngs are then to be seen hurrying together,
what anxious enquiries appear to be made, and what earnest
parleys are going on among them as they meet! We see
even the very stones worn away by their footsteps, and roads
beaten down by being the scene of their labors. Let no one
fail to see how much can be effected by assiduity and application,
even in the very humblest of objects! Ants are the
only living beings, besides
man, that bestow
burial on the dead.</p>

<p>The horns of an Indian
ant, suspended in
the temple of Hercules,
at Erythr&aelig;, have been
looked upon as quite
miraculous for their
size. This ant excavates
gold from holes,
in a country in the
north of India, the inhabitants
of which are
known as the Dard&aelig;. It has the color of a cat, and is in size
as large as an Egyptian wolf.<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a> This gold, which it extracts
in the winter, is taken by the Indians during the heats of
summer, while the ants are compelled, by the excessive
warmth, to hide themselves in their holes. Still, however,
aroused by the scent of the Indians, they will sally forth, and
frequently tear them to pieces, though the Indians may be
provided with the swiftest camels for the purpose of flight;
so great is their fleetness, combined with their ferocity and
their passion for gold!</p>

<h2><span class="larger">Book IX.</span>
<br />THE NATURAL HISTORY OF METALS.</h2>
<h2 id="c101"><span class="large">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />GOLD.</h2>
<p>We are now about to speak of metals, of actual wealth, the
standard of comparative value, objects for which we diligently
search, within the earth, in numerous ways. In one place, for
instance, we undermine it for the purpose of obtaining riches,
to supply the exigencies of life, searching for either gold or
silver, electrum or copper. In another place, to satisfy the
requirements of luxury, our researches extend to gems and
pigments, with which to adorn our fingers and the walls of
our houses: while in a third place, we gratify our rash propensities
by a search for iron, which, amid wars and carnage,
is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We trace out all
the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, undermined as
it is beneath our feet, are astonished that it should occasionally
cleave asunder or tremble: as though, forsooth, these
signs could be any other than expressions of the indignation
felt by our sacred parent! We penetrate into her entrails,
and seek for treasures in the abodes even of the Manes as
though each spot we tread upon were not sufficiently bounteous
and fertile for us!</p>
<p>And yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies
the object of our researches: and how few in thus delving
into the earth have in view the promotion of medicinal knowledge!
For upon her surface she has presented us with these
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
substances, equally with the cereals, bounteous and ever
ready, as she is, in supplying us with all things for our benefit!
It is what is concealed from our view, what is sunk far beneath
her surface, objects, in fact, of no rapid formation, that
urge us to our ruin, that send us to the very depths of hell.
As the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us only consider,
proceeding through all ages, as these operations are, when
will be the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what
point will avarice finally penetrate! How innocent, how
happy, how truly delightful would life be, if we were to desire
nothing but what is to be found upon the face of the earth;
in a word, nothing but what is provided ready to our hands!</p>
<p>Gold is dug out of the earth, and, in close proximity to it,
chrysocolla, a substance which, that it may appear all the
more precious, still retains the name which it has borrowed
from gold. It was not enough for us to have discovered one
bane for the human race, but we must set a value too upon
the very humors of gold.</p>
<p>Alas for the prodigal inventions of man! in how many
ways have we augmented the value of things! In addition to
the standard value of these metals, the art of painting lends
its aid, and we have rendered gold and silver still more costly
by the art of chasing them. Man has learned how to challenge
both Nature and art to become the incitements to vice!
But in lapse of time, the metals passed out of fashion, and
men began to make no account of them; gold and silver, in
fact, became too common. From this same earth we have
extracted vessels and vases of crystal, objects the very fragility
of which is considered to enhance their value. In fact, it
has come to be looked upon as a proof of opulence, and as
quite the glory of luxury, to possess that which may be irremediably
destroyed in an instant. Nor was even this enough;&mdash;we
now drink from a mass of gems, and we set our goblets
with smaragdi; we take delight in possessing the wealth of
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
India, as the promoter of intoxication, and gold is now nothing
more than a mere accessory.</p>
<p>Would that gold could have been banished forever from
the earth, accursed by universal report, as some of the most
celebrated writers have expressed themselves, reviled by the
reproaches of the best of men, and looked upon as discovered
only for the ruin of mankind. How much more happy the
age when things themselves were bartered for one another;
as was the case in the times of the Trojan war, if we are to
believe what Homer says. For, in this way, in my opinion,
was commerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries
of life. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by
bartering ox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil
which they had taken from the enemy: and yet he himself,
already an admirer of gold, was so far aware of the relative
value of things, that Glaucus, he informs us, exchanged his
arms of gold, valued at one hundred oxen, for those of Diomedes,
which were worth but nine.</p>
<h2 id="c102"><span class="large">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE ORIGIN OF GOLD RINGS.</h2>
<p>The worst crime against mankind was committed by him
who was the first to put a ring upon his fingers. All the
stories told about Prometheus, I look upon as utterly fabulous,
although I am aware that the ancients used to represent
him with a ring of iron: it was their intention, however, to
signify a chain thereby, and not an ornament. As to the ring
of Midas, which, upon the collet being turned inwards, conferred
invisibility upon the wearer, who is there that must not
admit, perforce, that this story is even still more fabulous?
It was the hand, and a sinister hand, too, in every sense, that
first brought gold into such high repute: not a Roman hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
however, for upon that it was the practice to wear a ring of
iron only, solely as an indication of warlike prowess.</p>
<p>As to the usage followed by the Roman kings, it is not
easy to pronounce an opinion: the statue of Romulus in the
Capitol wears no ring, nor does any other statue&mdash;not that of
L. Brutus even&mdash;with the sole exception of those of Numa
and Servius Tullius. I am surprised at this absence of the
ring, in the case of the Tarquinii more particularly, seeing
that they were originally from Greece, a country from which
the use of gold rings was first introduced; though even at the
present day the people of Laced&aelig;mon are in the habit of
wearing rings made of iron. Tarquinius Priscus was the first
who presented his son with the golden bulla, on the occasion
of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside the pr&aelig;texta;
from which period the custom of wearing the bulla has
been continued, a distinction confined to the children of those
who have served in the cavalry, those of other persons simply
wearing a leather thong. Such being the case, I am the
more surprised that the statue of this Tarquinius should be
without a ring.</p>
<p>Rings were given, at the public expense, to those who were
about to proceed on an embassy to foreign nations, the
reason being, I suppose, because men of highest rank among
foreign nations were perceived to be thus distinguished.
Nor was it the practice for any person to wear these rings,
except those who for this reason had received them at the
public expense; and in most instances the Roman generals
celebrated their public triumphs without this distinction.
Those, too, who had received golden rings on the occasion of
an embassy, wore them only when in public, resuming the
ring of iron when in their houses. At the present day only
an iron ring is sent by way of present to a woman when
betrothed, and that, too, without any stone in it.</p>
<p>For my own part, I do not find that any rings were used in
the days of the Trojan War; at all events, Homer nowhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
mentions them; for although he speaks of the practice of
sending tablets by way of letters, of clothes and gold and
silver plate being kept laid up in chests, still he gives us to
understand that they were kept secure by the aid of a knot
tied fast, and not under a seal impressed by a ring.</p>
<p>It was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger,
the one next to the little finger; and this we see the case in
the statues of Numa and Servius Tullius. In later times, it
became the practice to put rings on the finger next to the
thumb, even in the case of the statues of the gods; and more
recently, again, it has been the fashion to wear them upon
the little finger as well. Among the peoples of Gallia and
Britannia, the middle finger, it is said, is used for this purpose.
At the present day, however, among us, this is the
only finger that is excepted, all the others being loaded with
rings, smaller rings even being separately adapted for the
smaller joints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several
rings upon the little finger alone; while others, again,
wear but one ring upon this finger, the ring that sets a seal
upon the signet-ring itself, this last being kept carefully shut
up as an object of rarity, too precious to be worn in common
use, and only to be taken from the cabinet as from a sanctuary.
And thus is the wearing of a single ring upon the little
finger no more than an ostentatious advertisement that the
owner has property of a more precious nature under seal at
home!</p>
<h2 id="c103"><span class="large">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />COINS OF GOLD.</h2>
<p>The next crime committed against the welfare of mankind
was on the part of him who was the first to coin a denarius of
gold, a crime the author of which is equally unknown. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
Roman people made no use of impressed silver even before
the period of the defeat of King Pyrrhus.</p>
<p>King Servius was the first to make an impress upon copper.
Before his time, according to Tim&aelig;us, at Rome, the raw metal
only was used. The form of a sheep was the first figure impressed
upon money, and to this fact it owes its name, &ldquo;pecunia,&rdquo;
from &ldquo;pecus,&rdquo; a sheep.</p>
<p>Silver was not impressed with a mark until the year of the
City 485, the year of the consulship of Ogulnius and Fabius,
five years before the First Punic War; at which time it was
ordained that the value of the denarius should be ten asses of
copper. The weight, however, of the libra of copper was
diminished during the First Punic War, the republic not having
means to meet its expenditure: in consequence of which,
an ordinance was made that the as should in future be struck
of two ounces weight. By this contrivance a saving of five-sixths
was effected, and the public debt was liquidated. The
impression upon these copper coins was a two-faced Janus on
one side, and the beak of a ship of war on the other. At a
later period, when Hannibal was pressing hard upon Rome,
in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius Maximus, asses of one ounce
weight were struck, and it was ordained that the value of the
denarius should be sixteen asses, by which last reduction of
the weight of the as the republic made a clear gain of one
half. Still, however, so far as the pay of the soldiers is concerned,
one denarius has always been given for every ten
asses. The impressions upon the coins of silver were two-horse
and four-horse chariots, and hence it is that they received
the names of &ldquo;bigati&rdquo; and &ldquo;quadrigati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that
of silver.</p>
<p>But the invention of money opened a new field to human
avarice, by giving rise to the practice of lending money at interest,
while the owner passes a life of idleness: and it was
with no slow advances that, not merely avarice, but a perfect
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
hunger for gold became inflamed with a sort of rage for acquiring.
Septimuleius, the familiar friend of Caius Gracchus,
not only cut off the latter&rsquo;s head, upon which a price had
been set of its weight in gold, but, before bringing it to
Opimius, poured molten lead into the mouth, and so not only
was guilty of the crime of parricide, but added to his criminality
by cheating the state. And the Roman name was rendered
infamous by avarice, when King Mithridates caused
molten gold to be poured into the mouth of Aquilius, the
Roman general, whom he had taken prisoner.</p>
<p>One cannot but feel ashamed, on looking at those new-fangled
names which are invented every now and then, from
the Greek language, by which to designate vessels of silver,
filagreed or inlaid with gold, and the various other practices
by which such articles of luxury, when only gilded, are made
to sell at a higher price than they would have done if made of
solid gold. Spartacus forbade any one of his followers to
introduce either gold or silver into the camp&mdash;so much more
nobleness of mind was there in those days, even in runaway
slaves.</p>
<p>I am much surprised that the Roman people has always
imposed upon conquered nations a tribute in silver, and not
in gold. From Carthage, after its conquest under Hannibal,
a ransom was exacted in the shape of a yearly payment, for
fifty years, of silver, eight hundred thousand pounds&rsquo; weight
in all, but no gold. And yet it does not appear that this
could have arisen from there being so little gold then in use
throughout the world. Midas and Cr&oelig;sus, before this, had
possessed gold to an endless amount: Cyrus, on his conquest
of Asia, had found a booty consisting of twenty-four thousand
pounds&rsquo; weight of gold, in addition to vessels and other
articles of wrought gold, as well as leaves of trees, a plane-tree,
and a vine, all made of that metal. In this conquest, he
carried off five hundred thousand talents of silver, as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
the vase<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a> of Semiramis, the weight of which alone amounted
to fifteen talents.</p>
<p>Saulaces, king of Colchis, the land of the Golden Fleece,
had golden arches to his palace, and silver supports, columns,
and pilasters, all of which he had come into possession of
on the conquest of Sesostris, king of Egypt; a monarch so
haughty, that every year, it is said, it was his practice to
select one of his vassal kings by lot, and yoking him to his
car, celebrate his triumph afresh.</p>
<p>At the games celebrated by Caius Antonius the stage was
made of silver. The Emperor Caius had a scaffold introduced
into the Circus, upon which there were one hundred
and twenty-four thousand pounds&rsquo; weight of silver. His successor,
Claudius, on the occasion of his triumph over Britain,
announced by the inscriptions that among the coronets of
gold, there was one weighing seven thousand pounds, contributed
by Nearer Spain, and another of nine thousand
pounds, presented by Gallia Comata. Nero, who succeeded
him, covered the Theatre of Pompey with gold for one day,
the occasion on which he displayed it to Tiridates, king of
Armenia. And yet how small was this theatre in comparison
with that Golden Palace of his, with which he environed our
city.</p>
<p>The first statue of solid gold was erected in the Temple of
the goddess Ana&iuml;tis, a divinity held in the highest veneration.
This statue was carried off during the wars of Antonius with
the people of Parthia; and a witty saying is told, with reference
to it, of one of the veterans of the Roman army, a native
of Bononia. Entertaining on one occasion the late
Emperor Augustus at dinner, he was asked by that prince
whether he was aware that the person who committed the
violence of carrying off the statue, had been struck with blindness
and paralysis, and then expired. To this he made answer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
that at that very moment Augustus was making his dinner
off of one of her legs, for he himself was the very man,
and to that bit of plunder he had been indebted for all his
fortune.</p>
<h2 id="c104"><span class="large">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />SILVER.</h2>
<p>We come next to speak of silver ore, another egregious
folly of mankind. Silver is never found but in shafts sunk
deep in the ground, there being no indications on the surface
to raise hopes of its existence, no shining sparkles, as in the
case of gold. The earth in which it is found is sometimes
red, sometimes of an ashy hue. It is impossible, too, to melt
it, except in combination with lead or galena, the latter being
the name given to the vein of lead that is mostly found running
near the veins of the silver ore. When submitted to the
action of fire, part of the ore precipitates itself in the form of
lead, while the silver is left floating on the surface, like oil<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a>
on water.</p>
<p>Silver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of
all is that of Spain; where it is found, like gold, in uncultivated
soils, and in the mountains. Wherever one vein of silver
has been met with, another is sure to be found not far off:
a fact that has been remarked in the case of nearly all the
metals, which have thus derived their Greek name of
&ldquo;metalla.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a>
It is a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by
Hannibal in the Spanish provinces are still worked, their
names being derived from the persons who were the first to
discover them. One of these mines, still called B&aelig;belo at the
present day, furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
weight of silver per day. The mountain is excavated for a
distance of fifteen hundred paces; and throughout the whole
of this distance water-bearers stand night and day, baling out
the water in turns, by the dim light of torches.</p>
<p>The vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is
known by the name of &ldquo;crudaria,&rdquo; raw silver. In ancient
times, the excavations used to be abandoned the moment
alum was met with, and no further search was made. Of late,
however, the discovery of a vein of copper beneath alum, has
withdrawn any such limits to man&rsquo;s hopes. The exhalations
from silver-mines are dangerous to all animals, particularly to
dogs. The softer they are, the more beautiful gold and silver
are considered.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece upon
an iron-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains perfectly
white, it is of the best quality: if it turns a reddish color, it
is inferior; but if it becomes black, it is worthless. Fraud,
however, has devised means of stultifying this test even; for
by keeping the shovel immersed in ammonia, the piece of
silver absorbs it as it burns, and so displays a fictitious whiteness.</p>
<h2 id="c105"><span class="large">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />MIRRORS.</h2>
<p>It is generally supposed among us that only the very finest
silver admits of being laminated, and so converted into mirrors.
Pure silver was formerly used for the purpose, but, at
the present day, this has been corrupted by the devices of
fraud. But, really, it is a very marvellous property that this
metal has, of reflecting objects. If a thick plate of this
metal is highly polished, and is rendered slightly concave, the
image or object reflected is enlarged to an immense extent.
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
Even more than this&mdash;drinking-cups are now made in such a
manner, as to be filled inside with numerous concave facets,
like so many mirrors; so that if but one person looks into
the interior, he sees reflected a whole multitude of persons.</p>
<p>Mirrors invented to reflect monstrous forms have been
consecrated in the Temple at Smyrna. It makes all the difference
whether the surface has a concave form like the section
of a drinking cup, or whether it is convex like a Thracian
buckler; the peculiar configuration of the surface which
receives the shadows, causing them to undergo corresponding
distortions: for, in fact, the image is nothing else but the
shadow of the object collected upon the bright surface of the
metal.</p>
<p>However, to finish our description of mirrors on the present
occasion&mdash;the best, in the times of our ancestors, were
those of Brundisium, composed of a mixture of stannum and
copper: at a later period those made of silver were preferred,
Pasiteles being the first Roman who made them, in the time
of Pompey the Great.</p>
<p>The people of Egypt stain their silver vessels, that they
may see represented in them their god Anubis; and it is the
custom with them to paint, and not to chase, their silver.
This usage has now passed to our own triumphal statues;
and, a truly marvellous fact, the value of silver has been
enhanced by deadening its brilliancy. The following is the
method adopted: with the silver are mixed two-thirds of the
very finest Cyprian copper, that known as &ldquo;coronarium,&rdquo; and
a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of the silver. The
whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel well
luted with potter&rsquo;s clay, the operation being completed when
the cover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admits
also of being blackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg;
a tint, however, which is removed by the application of vinegar
and chalk.</p>
<p>The Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius with
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
iron: and in spurious coin there is an alloy of copper employed.
It is truly marvellous, that in this art, and in this
only, the various methods of falsification should be made a
study:<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a> for the sample of the false denarius is now an object
of careful examination, and people absolutely buy the counterfeit
coin at the price of many genuine ones!</p>
<h2 id="c106"><span class="large">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />INSTANCES OF IMMENSE WEALTH.</h2>
<p>The ancients had no number whereby to express a larger
sum than one hundred thousand; and at the present day, we
reckon by multiples of that number, as, for instance, ten
times one hundred thousand, and so on. For these multiplications
we are indebted to usury and the use of coined
money; hence the expressions &ldquo;&aelig;s alienum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;another
man&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; which we still use to signify debt, and in later
times the surname &ldquo;Dives,&rdquo; rich: only be it known to all,
that the man who first received this surname became a bankrupt
and bubbled his creditors.<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> Marcus Crassus, a member
of the same family, used to say that no man was rich who
could not maintain a legion upon his yearly income. He
possessed in land two hundred millions of sesterces, being the
richest Roman citizen next to Sylla. Nor was even this
enough for him, but he must want to possess all the gold of
the Parthians too!<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a> And yet, although he was the first to
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
become memorable for his opulence&mdash;so pleasant is the task
of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity&mdash;we have known of
many manumitted slaves, since his time, much more wealthy
than he ever was; three for example, all at the same time, in
the reign of the Emperor Claudius: Pallas, Callistus, and
Narcissus.</p>
<p>But to omit further mention of these men, let us turn to
Caius C&aelig;cilius Claudius Isidorus, who, in the consulship of
Gallus and Censorinus, upon the sixth day before the calends
of February, declared by his will, that though he had suffered
great losses through the civil wars, he was still able to leave
behind him four thousand one hundred and sixteen slaves,
three thousand six hundred pairs of oxen, and two hundred
and fifty-seven thousand heads of other kind of cattle, besides,
in ready money, sixty millions of sesterces. Upon his funeral,
also, he ordered eleven hundred thousand sesterces to
be expended.</p>
<p>And yet, supposing all these enormous riches to be added
together, how small a proportion will they bear to the wealth
of Ptolem&aelig;us; the person who, according to Varro, when
Pompey was on his expedition in the countries adjoining
Jud&aelig;a, entertained eight thousand horsemen at his own expense,
and gave a repast to one thousand guests, setting
before every one of them a drinking-cup of gold, and changing
these vessels at every course! And then, again, how
insignificant would his wealth have been by the side of that
of Pythius the Bithynian<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a>&mdash;for I here make no mention of
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
kings. He it was who gave the celebrated plane-tree and
vine of gold to King Darius, and who entertained at a banquet
the troops of Xerxes, seven hundred and eighty-eight
thousand men in all; with a promise of pay and corn for the
whole of them during the next five months, on condition that
one at least of his five children, who had been drawn for service,
should be left to him as the solace of his old age. And
yet, let any one compare the wealth of Pythius to that possessed
by King Cr&oelig;sus!</p>
<p>In the name of all that is unfortunate, what madness it is
for human nature to centre its desires upon a thing that has
either fallen to the lot of slaves, or else has reached no known
limit in the aspirations even of kings!</p>
<h2 id="c107"><span class="large">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN SILVER PLATE.</h2>
<p>The caprice of the human mind is marvellously exemplified
in the varying fashions of silver plate; the work of no individual
manufactory being for any long time in vogue. At
one period, the Furnian<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a> plate, at another the Clodian, and
at another the Gratian, is all the rage&mdash;for we borrow the
shop even at our tables. Now again, it is embossed plate
that we are in search of, and silver deeply chiselled around
the marginal lines of the figures painted upon it; and now
we are building up on our sideboards fresh tiers of shelves
for supporting the various dishes.</p>
<p>We find the orator Calvus complaining that the saucepans
are made of silver; but it has been left for us to invent a plan
of covering our very carriages with chased silver, and in our
own age Popp&aelig;a, the wife of the Emperor Nero, ordered her
favorite mules to be shod with gold!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>The younger Scipio Africanus left to his heir thirty-two
pounds&rsquo; weight of silver: the same person who, on his triumph
over the Carthaginians, displayed four thousand three
hundred and seventy pounds&rsquo; weight of that metal. Such
was the sum total of the silver possessed by the whole of the
inhabitants of Carthage, that rival of Rome for the empire of
the world! How many a Roman since then has surpassed
her in his display of plate for a single table! After the destruction
of Numantia, the same Africanus gave to his soldiers,
on the day of his triumph, a largess of seven denarii
each&mdash;and right worthy were they of such a general, when
satisfied with such a sum! His brother, Scipio Allobrogicus,
was the very first who possessed one thousand pounds&rsquo; weight
of silver, but Drusus Livius, when he was tribune of the
people, possessed ten thousand. That an ancient warrior,
Rufinus the consul, a man, too, who had enjoyed a triumph,
should have incurred the notice of the censor for being in
possession of five pounds&rsquo; weight of silver, is a thing that
would appear quite fabulous at the present day.</p>
<p>For a long time past it has been the fashion to plate the
couches of our women, as well as some of our banqueting-couches,
entirely with silver. Two centuries ago these
couches were invented, as well as chargers of silver, one hundred
pounds in weight: it is a well-known fact, that there
were then upwards of one hundred and fifty of these in Rome,
and that many persons were proscribed through the devices
of others who were desirous to gain possession thereof. Well
may our Annals be put to the blush for having to impute
those civil wars to the existence of such vices as these!</p>
<p>Our own age, however, has waxed even stronger in this
respect. In the reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus, surnamed
Rotundus, who acted as his steward in Nearer Spain,
possessed a silver charger weighing five hundred pounds, for
the manufacture of which a workshop had to be expressly
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
built. This charger was accompanied also by eight other
dishes, each two hundred and fifty pounds in weight. How
many of his fellow-slaves, pray, would it have taken to introduce
these dishes, or who were to be the guests served therefrom?
Compare this extravagance with the simplicity of the
times of Fabricius, who would allow no general of an army to
have any other plate of silver than a patera and a salt-cellar.&mdash;Oh
that he could see how that the rewards of valor in our
day are either composed of these objects of luxury, or are
broken up to make them! Alas for the morals of our age!
Fabricius puts us to the blush.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the art of chasing gold should
have conferred no celebrity upon any person, while that of
embossing silver has rendered many illustrious. The greatest
renown, however, has been acquired by Mentor. Aside from
single pieces only four pairs of vases were ever made by him,
and at the present day not one of these, it is said, is any
longer in existence, owing to the conflagrations of the Temple
of Diana at Ephesus and of that in the Capitol. Varro
informs us in his writings that he also was in possession of a
bronze statue, the work of this artist. Zopyrus represented
the court of the Areopagus and the trial of Orestes for the
murder of his mother Clyt&aelig;mnestra upon two cups valued at
twelve thousand sesterces. There was Pytheas also, a work
of whose sold at the rate of ten thousand denarii for two
ounces: it was a drinking-bowl, the figures on which represented
Ulysses and Diomedes stealing the Palladium from
Troy. The same artist engraved also, upon some small
drinking-vessels, kitchen scenes of such remarkably fine workmanship
and so liable to injury, that it was quite impossible to
take copies of them by moulding. Teucer, too, the inlayer,
enjoyed a great reputation.</p>
<p>All at once, however, this art became so lost in point of
excellence, that at the present day ancient specimens are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
only ones at all valued; and only those pieces of plate are
held in esteem the designs on which are so much worn that
the figures cannot be distinguished.</p>
<h2 id="c108"><span class="large">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />BRONZE.<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a></h2>
<p>We must, in the next place, give an account of the ores of
bronze, an alloy which, in respect of utility, is next in value;
indeed the Corinthian bronze comes before silver, not to say
almost before gold itself. It is also the standard of monetary
value; I have already mentioned that for a great length of
time the Roman people employed no coin except bronze, and
there is another ancient fact which proves that the esteem in
which it was held was of equal antiquity with that of the City
itself, the circumstance that the third associated body which
Numa established, was that of the braziers.<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a></p>
<p>The most highly esteemed copper is procured beyond the
seas; it was formerly obtained in Campania, and at present is
found in the country of the Bergomates, at the extremity of
Italy. It is said to have been lately discovered also in the
province of Germany.</p>
<p>Formerly a mixture was made of copper fused with gold
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
and silver, and the workmanship in this metal was considered
even more valuable than the material itself; but, at the present
day, it is difficult to say whether the workmanship in it,
or the material, is the worse. But in this, as in everything
else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation, is
now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. This art was
ascribed to the gods themselves, and men of rank in all countries
endeavored to acquire fame by the practice of it, but we
have now so entirely lost the method of making this valuable
compound by fusion, that, for a long time past, not even
chance itself has assumed the privilege which formerly belonged
to art.</p>
<p>Next to this compound, so celebrated in antiquity, the
Corinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. This
was a compound produced by accident, when Corinth was
burnt at the time of its capture. There has been a wonderful
mania with many for gaining possession of this metal.
Verres, whom Cicero caused to be condemned, was proscribed
by Antonius, along with Cicero, for no other reason than his
refusal to give up some specimens of Corinthian bronze which
were in his possession.</p>
<p>Corinth was captured in the third year of the 158th Olympiad,
being the year of the City, 608,<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a> some ages after the
period when those artists flourished, who produced all the
specimens of what these persons now call Corinthian metal.
The only genuine Corinthian vessels are those which these
men of taste metamorphose, sometimes into table dishes,
sometimes into lamps, or even into wash-basins, without any
regard to decency. They are of three kinds; the white
variety, approaching very nearly to the splendor of silver, and
in which that metal forms a large proportion of the compound;
a second kind, in which the yellow color of gold predominates;
and a third, in which all the metals are mixed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
equal proportions. Besides these, there is another mixture,
the composition of which it is impossible to describe, for
although it has been formed into images and statues by the
hand of man, it is chance that rules in the formation of the
compound. The last is highly prized for its color, which
approaches to that of liver, but is far inferior to the Corinthian
metal, though much superior to the &AElig;ginetan and Delian,
which long held the first rank.</p>
<p>The Delian bronze was the first that became famous, all the
world coming to Delos to purchase it; and hence the attention
paid to the manufacture of it. It was in this island that
bronze first obtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feet
and supports of dining-couches. After some time it came to
be employed for the statues of the gods and the effigies of
men and other animated beings.</p>
<p>The next most esteemed bronze was the &AElig;ginetan; the
island being famous not for the metal produced there, but
because the annealing of the &AElig;ginetan manufactories was so
excellent. A bronze Ox, which was taken from this island,
now stands in the cattle market at Rome. This is a typical
specimen of the &AElig;ginetan metal, as the Jupiter in the Temple
of Jupiter Tonans, in the Capitol, is of the Delian. Myron
used the former metal and Polycletus the latter; they were
contemporaries and fellow-pupils, and there was great rivalry
between them.</p>
<p>&AElig;gina was particularly famous for the manufacture of
sockets for lamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of the
branches; the most complete articles were, therefore, produced
by the union of the two. There are persons who are
not ashamed to give for one a sum equal to the salary of a
military tribune, although, as its name indicates, its only use
is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of one of these
lamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the purchaser
must also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, a
fuller, who was hump-backed, and in other respects of a hideous
<span class="pb" id="Page_271">271</span>
aspect. The purchase was made by a lady named
Gegania, for fifty thousand sesterces.</p>
<p>The ancients were in the habit of making the door-sills and
even the doors of the temples of bronze. Cneius Manlius was
the first who introduced bronze banqueting-couches, buffets,
and tables with single feet, when he entered the City in triumph,
in the year of Rome 567, after his conquests in Asia.
We also learn from Antias, that the heirs of Lucius Crassus,
the orator, sold a number of banqueting-couches adorned
with bronze. The tripods, which were called Delphian, because
they were devoted more particularly to receiving the
offerings that were presented to the Delphian Apollo, were
usually made of bronze: also the pendant lamps, so much admired,
which were placed in the temples, or gave their light in
the form of trees loaded with fruit.</p>
<h2 id="c109"><span class="large">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />STATUES OF BRONZE.</h2>
<p>But after some time the artists everywhere applied themselves
to representations of the gods. I find that the first
bronze image, which was made at Rome, was that of Ceres;
and that the expenses were defrayed out of the property that
belonged to Spurius Cassius, who was put to death by his own
father, for aspiring to the regal office. The practice, however,
soon passed from the gods to the statues and representations
of men, and this in various forms. The ancients stained their
statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remarkable
that they were afterwards fond of covering them with gold.
I do not know whether this was a Roman invention; but it
certainly has the repute of being an ancient practice at Rome.</p>
<p>It was not the custom in former times to give the likeness
of individuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lasting
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
remembrance on account of some illustrious deed; in the first
instance, for a victory at the sacred games, and more particularly
the Olympic Games, where it was the usage for the
victors always to have their statues consecrated. And if any
one was so fortunate as to obtain the prize there three times,
his statue was made with the exact resemblance of every individual limb;
from which circumstance they were called
&ldquo;iconic&aelig;,&rdquo; or &ldquo;portrait statues.&rdquo; I do not know whether the
public statues were not erected by the Athenians, and in
honor of Harmodius and Aristogiton, who slew the tyrant,<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a>
an event which took place in the same year in which the
kings were expelled from Rome. This custom, from a most
praiseworthy emulation, was afterwards adopted by all other
nations; so that statues were erected as ornaments in the
public places of municipal towns, and the memory of individuals
was thus preserved, their various honors being inscribed
on the pedestals, to be read there by posterity, and not on
their tombs alone. After some time, a kind of forum or
public place came to be made in private houses and in our
halls, the clients adopting this method of doing honor to their
patrons.</p>
<p>In former times the statues that were thus dedicated were
clad in the toga. Naked statues also, brandishing a spear,
after the manner of the youths at their gymnastic exercises,
were much admired; these were called &ldquo;Achillean.&rdquo; The
Greek practice is, not to cover any part of the body; while,
on the contrary, the Roman and the military statues have the
addition of a cuirass. C&aelig;sar, the Dictator, permitted a statue
with a cuirass to be erected in honor of him in his Forum.
As to the statues which are made in the garb of the Luperci,<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
they are of no older date than those which have been lately
erected, covered with a cloak. Mancinus gave directions, that
he should be represented in the dress which he wore when he
was surrendered to the enemy. It has been remarked by
some authors, that Lucius Attius, the poet, had a statue of
himself erected in the Temple of the Muses, which was extremely
large, although he himself was very short.</p>
<p>Equestrian statues are also held in esteem in Rome; but
they are of Greek origin, no doubt. Among the Greeks,
those persons only were honored with equestrian statues who
were victors on horseback in the sacred games; though afterwards
the same distinction was bestowed on those who were
successful in the races with chariots with two or four horses:
hence the use of chariots with us in the statues of those who
have triumphed. But this did not take place until a late
period; and it was not until the time of the late Emperor
Augustus that we had chariots represented with six horses,<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a>
and also with elephants.</p>
<p>The custom of erecting chariots with two horses in honor
of those who had discharged the office of pr&aelig;tor, and had
passed round the Circus in a chariot, is not of ancient date.
That of placing statues on pillars is older, as it was done in
honor of Caius M&aelig;nius, who conquered the ancient Latins, to
whom the Romans by treaty gave one-third of the spoil which
they had obtained. It was in the same consulship also, that
the &ldquo;rostra&rdquo; or beaks of the ships, which had been taken from
the Antiates when vanquished, were affixed to the tribunal;
in the year of the City, 416.</p>
<p>For a very different, and more important reason, was the
statue of Horatius Cocles erected, he having singly prevented
the enemy from passing the Sublician bridge: a statue which
remains to this day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>Then we have the statues of Romulus and Tatius without
the tunic; and the equestrian statue of Marcius Tremulus,
clad in the toga, before the Temple of the Castors, who twice
subdued the Samnites, and by the capture of Anagnia delivered
the people from their tribute.</p>
<p>Nor must I forget to mention Cneius Octavius, on account
of the language used by the senate. When King Antiochus
said, &ldquo;I will give you an answer at another time,&rdquo; Octavius
drew a line round him with a stick, which he happened to
have in his hand, and compelled him to give an answer before
he allowed him to step beyond the circle. Octavius was unfortunately
slain<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a> while on this embassy, and the senate ordered
his statue to be placed in the most conspicuous spot, which of
course was the Rostra. A statue appears also to have been
decreed to Taracia Caia, or Furetia, a Vestal Virgin, the same,
too, to be placed wherever she might think fit; an additional
honor, no less remarkable, it is thought, than the grant itself
of a statue to a woman. I will state her merits in the words
of the Annals: &ldquo;Because she had gratuitously presented to
the public the field bordering on the Tiber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find also, that statues were erected in honor of Pythagoras
and of Alcibiades, in the corners of the Comitium; in obedience
to the command of the Pythian Apollo, who, in the
Samnite War, had directed that statues of the bravest and the
wisest of the Greeks should be erected in some conspicuous
spot: and here they remained until Sylla, the Dictator, built
the senate-house on the site. It is wonderful that the senate
should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates, who, in
consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all other
men by the god himself; as, also, that they should have preferred
Alcibiades for valor to so many other heroes; or, indeed,
any one to Themistocles, who so greatly excelled in both
qualities. The reason of the statues being raised on columns,
was, that the persons represented might be elevated above
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
other mortals; the same thing being signified by the use of
arches, a new invention which had its origin among the Greeks.
I am of opinion that there is no one to whom more statues
were erected than to Demetrius Phalereus at Athens: for
there were three hundred and sixty erected in his honor, no
more days being reckoned at that period in the year: these,
however, were soon broken to pieces.</p>
<p>Pedestrian statues have been, undoubtedly, for a long time
in estimation at Rome: equestrian statues are, however, of
considerable antiquity, and women even have participated in
this honor; for the statue of Cl&aelig;lia is equestrian, as if it had
not been thought sufficient to have her clad in the toga.</p>
<p>There are still extant some declamations by Cato, during
his censorship, against the practice of erecting statues of
women in the Roman provinces. However, he could not
prevent a statue being erected at Rome to Cornelia, the
mother of the Gracchi, and daughter of the elder Scipio
Africanus. She is represented in a sitting posture, and the
statue is remarkable for having no straps to the shoes.</p>
<p>Various circumstances prove, that the art of making statues
was commonly practised in Italy at an early period. The
statue in the Cattle Market is said to have been consecrated
to Hercules by Evander; it is called the triumphal Hercules,
and, on the occasion of triumphal processions, is arrayed in
triumphal vestments. King Numa dedicated the statue of
the two-faced Janus; a deity who is worshipped as presiding
over both peace and war. The fingers are so formed as to
indicate three hundred and sixty-five days,<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> or in other words,
the year; thus denoting that he is the god of time and duration.</p>
<p>There are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various parts
of the world, which beyond a doubt were originally made in
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
Etruria. I should have supposed that these had been the
statues only of divinities, had not Metrodorus of Scepsis, who
had his surname &ldquo;Misorom&aelig;us,&rdquo; from his hatred to the
Roman name, reproached us with having pillaged the city of
Volsinii for the sake of the two thousand statues which it
contained. It appears to me a singular fact, that although
the origin of statues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the
images of the gods, which were consecrated to them in their
temples, should have been formed either of wood or of
earthenware, until the conquest of Asia, which introduced
luxury among us. It
will be the best plan
to enlarge upon the
origin of the art of
expressing likenesses,
when we come to speak
of what the Greeks call
&ldquo;the plastic art,&rdquo; for
the art of modelling
was prior to that of
statuary. This last, however, has flourished to such an extraordinary
degree that a full account of it would fill many
volumes.</p>

</div>
<p>We learn from Mucianus, who was thrice consul, that there
are still three thousand statues in Rhodes, and it is supposed
that there are no fewer in existence at Athens, at Olympia,
and at Delphi. What living mortal could enumerate them
all? or of what utility would be such information? Still, I
may, perhaps, afford entertainment by giving some slight
account of such of those works of art as are in any way
remarkable, and stating the names of the more celebrated
artists. Of each of these it would be impossible to enumerate
all the productions, for Lysippus alone is said to have
executed no less than fifteen hundred works of art, all of
which were of such excellence that any one of them might
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
have immortalized him. The number was ascertained by his
heir, upon opening his coffers after his death, as it was his
practice to lay up one golden denarius out of the sum which
he had received as the price of each statue.</p>
<p>This art has arrived at incredible perfection, both in successfulness
and in boldness of design. As a proof of successfulness,
I will adduce one example, and that of a figure which
represented neither god nor man. We have seen in our own
time, in the Capitol, before it was last burnt by the party of
Vitellius, in the shrine of Juno, a bronze figure of a dog licking
its wounds. Its miraculous excellence and its perfect
truthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance of its
having been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind of
security that was taken for its safety; for since no sum appeared
equal to its value, it was publicly enacted that the
keepers of it should be answerable for its safety with their
lives.</p>
<h2 id="c110"><span class="large">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />THE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE CITY.</h2>
<p>As to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable;
for we had statues of colossal bulk, equal to towers in size.
Such, for instance, is the Apollo in the Capitol, which was
brought by Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of Pontus, thirty
cubits in height, and which cost five hundred talents: also the
statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius, dedicated by the
late Emperor Claudius, but which appears dwarfed from its
vicinity to the Theatre of Pompey: and the Jupiter at Tarentum,
forty cubits in height, the work of Lysippus. It is a
remarkable circumstance that although this statue is so nicely
balanced as to be movable by the hand, it has never been
thrown down by a tempest. This, the artist guarded against,
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
by a column erected at a short distance from it, upon the
side on which the violence of the wind required to be broken.
On account of its magnitude, and the great difficulty of moving
it, Fabius Maximus did not touch it, when he transferred
the Hercules from that place to the Capitol, where it now
stands.</p>
<p>But far the most worthy of our admiration is the colossal
statue of the Sun, which stood formerly at Rhodes, and was
the work of Chares the Lindian, a pupil of Lysippus;<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a> no
less than seventy cubits in height. This statue, fifty-six years
after it was erected, was thrown down by an earthquake; but
even as it lies, it excites our wonder and admiration. Few
men can clasp the thumb in their arms, and its fingers are
larger than most statues. Where the limbs are broken
asunder, vast caverns are seen yawning in the interior.
Within it, too, are to be seen large masses of rock, by the
weight of which the artist steadied it while erecting it. It
was twelve years before this statue was completed, and three
hundred talents were expended upon it; a sum raised from
the engines of warfare which had been abandoned by King
Demetrius when tired of the long-protracted siege of Rhodes.
In the same city are other colossal statues, one hundred in
number; which though smaller than the one already mentioned,
would, any one of them, wherever erected, have ennobled
the place. In addition to these, there are five colossal
statues of the gods, which were made by Bryaxis.</p>
<p>In Italy the Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple of
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
Augustus, is fifty feet in height from the toe; and it is a
question whether it is more remarkable for the quality of
the metal, or for the beauty of the workmanship. Spurius
Carvilius erected the
statue of Jupiter.
Capitolinus, after he
had conquered the
Samnites, who fought
in obedience to a
most solemn oath;
it was formed out of
their breast-plates,
greaves, and helmets,
and is of such large
dimensions that it
may be seen from
the statue of Jupiter
Latiaris on the Alban Mount,
twelve
miles from Rome.
He made his own
statue, which is at
the feet of the other
one, out of the filings
of the metal.
There are also, in the
Capitol, two heads
which are very much
admired, and which
were dedicated by the Consul Lentulus, one of them executed
by the above-mentioned Chares, the other by Decius; but the
latter is so greatly excelled by the former, as to have all the
appearance of being the work of one of the poorest of artists.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig50">
<img src="images/i_p279.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="801" />
<p class="caption"><span class="small">COLOSSUS AT RHODES.</span></p>
</div>
<p>But all these gigantic statues have been surpassed in our
own age by the Mercury, made by Zenodotus for the city of
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
the Arverni in Gaul, which was ten years in completing, and
cost four hundred thousand sesterces. Having given sufficient
proof there of his artistic skill, he was sent for by Nero
to Rome, where he made a colossal statue intended to represent
that prince, one hundred and ten feet in height. In consequence,
however, of the public detestation of Nero&rsquo;s crimes,
this statue was consecrated to the Sun.<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> We used to admire
in his studio the accurate likeness not only in the model of
clay, but in the small sketches which served as the first foundation
of the work. This statue proves that the art of fusing
precious bronze was then lost, for Nero was prepared to furnish
the requisite gold and silver, and Zenodotus was inferior
to none of the ancients, either as a designer or as an engraver.
At the time that he was working at the statue for
the Arverni, he copied for Dubius Avitus, the governor of the
province, two drinking-cups, chased by the hand of Calamis,
which had been highly prized by Germanicus C&aelig;sar, and had
been given by him to his preceptor Cassius Silanus, the uncle
of Avitus; and this with such exactness, that they could
scarcely be distinguished from the originals.</p>
<h2 id="c111"><span class="large">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />AN ACCOUNT OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WORKS IN BRONZE, AND OF THE ARTISTS WHO EXECUTED THEM.</h2>
<p>An almost innumerable multitude of artists have been rendered
famous by their statues and figures of smaller size.
Before all others is Phidias, the Athenian,<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a> who executed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
Jupiter at Olympia, in ivory and gold, but who also made
figures in bronze as well. He flourished in the eighty-third
Olympiad, about the year of our City, 300. In the ninetieth
Olympiad there were Polycletus, Phradmon, Myron,
Pythagoras, Scopas, and Perellus. In the hundred and
fourth Olympiad, flourished Praxiteles<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a> and Euphranor; in
the hundred and thirteenth, Lysippus of Sicyon, who was
the contemporary of Alexander the Great, his brother Lysistratus,
and Silanion, who was remarkable for having acquired
great celebrity without any instructor: Zeuxis was his
pupil.</p>
<p>The most celebrated of these artists, though born at different
epochs, have joined in a trial of skill in the Amazons
which they have respectively made. When these statues
were dedicated in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was
agreed, in order to ascertain which was the best, that it
should be left to the judgment of the artists themselves who
were then present: upon which, it was evident that that was
the best, which all the artists agreed in considering as the
next best to his own. Accordingly, the first rank was assigned
to Polycletus, the second to Phidias, the third to Cresilas,
the fourth to Cydon, and the fifth to Phradmon.</p>
<p>Besides the Olympian Jupiter, which no one has ever
equalled, Phidias also executed in ivory the erect statue of
Minerva, which is in the Parthenon at Athens. He also
made in bronze, beside the Amazon above mentioned, a
Minerva, of such exquisite beauty, that it received its name
from its fine proportions. He also made the Cliduchus, and
another Minerva, which Paulus &AElig;milius dedicated at Rome
in the Temple of Fortune of the present day. Also the two
statues, draped with the pallium, which Catulus erected in the
same temple; and a nude colossal statue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Polycletus of Sicyon,<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> the pupil of Agelades, executed the
Diadumenos, the statue of an effeminate youth, and remarkable
for having cost one hundred talents; also the statue of a
youth full of manly vigor, and called the spear-bearer. In
this he made what the artists have called the Model statue,
from which, as from a sort of standard, they study the lineaments:
so that he, of all men, is thought in one work of art
to have exhausted all the resources of art. He also made
statues of a man using the body-scraper, and of a naked man
challenging to play at dice; as also of two naked boys playing
at dice, and known as the Astragalizontes; they are now
in the atrium of the Emperor Titus, and it is generally considered,
that there can be no work more perfect than this.
He also executed a Mercury, which was formerly at Lysimachia;
a Hercules seizing his arms, which is now at Rome.
Polycletus is generally considered as having attained the
highest excellence in statuary, and as having perfected the
art, which Phidias invented. A discovery which was entirely
his own, was the art of placing statues on one leg. It is remarked,
however, by Varro, that his statues are all square-built,
and made very much after the same model.</p>
<p>Myron of Eleuther&aelig;,<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a> who was also the pupil of Agelades,
was rendered more particularly famous by his statue of a
heifer, celebrated in many well-known lines. He also made
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
the figure of a dog, a Discobolus, a Perseus, the wood-sawyers,
a Satyr admiring a flute, and a Minerva, the Delphic
Pentathletes,<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a> the Pancratiast&aelig;,<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a> and a Hercules, which is at
the Circus Maximus, in the house of Pompey. Erinna of
Teios makes allusion in her poems to a monument which he
erected to a cricket and a locust. He also executed the
Apollo, which, after being taken from the Ephesians by the
Triumvir Antonius, was restored by the Emperor Augustus,
from a warning received in a dream. Myron appears to have
been the first to give a varied development to his art, having
made a greater number of designs than Polycletus, and shown
more attention to symmetry. And yet, though he was very
accurate in the proportions of his figures, he has neglected to
give much expression.</p>
<p>Pythagoras of Rhegium, in Italy, excelled him in the figure
of the Pancratiast which is now at Delphi. Pythagoras also
executed the statue of Astylos, the runner, which is exhibited
at Olympia; that of a Libyan boy holding a tablet, also in
the same place; and a nude male figure holding fruit. There
is at Syracuse a figure of a lame man by him: persons, when
looking at it, seem to feel the very pain of his wound. He
was the first artist who gave expression to the sinews and the
veins, and paid more attention to the hair.</p>
<p>There was also another Pythagoras, a Samian, who was
originally a painter, seven of whose nude figures, in the Temple
of Fortune, and one of an aged man, are very much admired.
He is said to have resembled the last-mentioned
artist so much in his features, that they could not be distinguished.</p>
<p>Lysippus was most prolific in his works, and made more
statues than any other artist. Among these, is the Man
using the Body-scraper, which Marcus Agrippa had erected
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
in front of his Warm Baths, and which wonderfully pleased
the Emperor Tiberius. This prince, although in the beginning
of his reign he imposed some restraint upon himself,
could not resist the temptation, and had this statue removed
to his bed-chamber, having substituted another for it at the
baths: the people, however, were so resolutely opposed to
this, that at the theatre they clamorously demanded the
Apoxyomenos to be replaced; and the prince, notwithstanding
his attachment to it, was obliged to restore it.</p>
<p>Lysippus is also celebrated for his statue of the intoxicated
Female Flute-player, his dogs and huntsmen, and, more particularly,
for his Chariot with the Sun, as represented by the
Rhodians. He also executed a numerous series of statues of
Alexander the Great, commencing from his childhood.<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a> The
Emperor Nero was so delighted with his statue of the infant
Alexander, that he had it gilt: this addition, however, to its
value, so detracted from its artistic beauty that the gold was
removed, and in this state it was looked upon as still more
precious, though disfigured by the scratches and seams which
remained upon it, and in which the gold was still to be seen.
He also made the statue of Heph&aelig;stion, the friend of Alexander
the Great, which some persons attribute to Polycletus,
whereas that artist lived nearly a century before his time.
Also the statue of Alexander at the chase, now consecrated
at Delphi, the figure of a Satyr, now at Athens, and the
Squadron of Alexander, all of whom he represented with the
greatest accuracy. This last work of art, after his conquest
of Macedonia, Metellus conveyed to Rome. Lysippus also
executed chariots of various kinds. He is considered to have
contributed very greatly to the art of statuary by expressing
the details of the hair, and by making the head smaller than
had been done by the ancients, and the body more graceful
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
less bulky, a method by which his statues were made to
appear taller. The Latin language has no appropriate name
for that &ldquo;symmetry,&rdquo; which he so attentively observed in his
new and hitherto untried method of modifying the squareness
observable in the ancient statues. Indeed, it was a common
saying of his, that other artists made men as they actually
were, while he made them as they appeared to be. One
peculiar characteristic of his work, is the finish and minuteness
which are observed in even the smallest details. Lysippus
left three sons, who were also his pupils, and became
celebrated as artists, Laippus, B&oelig;das, and, more particularly,
Euthycrates; though this last-named artist rivalled his father
in precision rather than in elegance, and preferred scrupulous
correctness to gracefulness. Nothing can be more expressive
than his Hercules at Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at
Thespi&aelig;, and his Equestrian Combat. Equally good, too,
are his statue of Trophonius, erected in the oracular cave of
that divinity, his numerous chariots, his Horse with the Panniers,
and his hounds.</p>
<p>Praxiteles, who excelled more particularly in marble, and
thence acquired his chief celebrity, also executed some very
beautiful works in bronze, the Rape of Proserpine, a Father
Liber, a figure of Drunkenness, and the celebrated Satyr.
He also made the youthful Apollo, known as the &ldquo;Sauroctonos&rdquo;
(Lizard-killer), because he is aiming an arrow at a
lizard which is stealing towards him.</p>
<p>His kindness of heart, too, is witnessed by another figure;
for in a chariot and horses which had been executed by Calamis,
he himself made the charioteer, in order that the artist,
who excelled in the representation of horses, might not be
considered deficient in the human figure. This last mentioned
artist has executed other chariots also, some with four
horses, and some with two; and in his horses he is always
unrivalled. But that it may not be supposed that he was so
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
greatly inferior in his human figures, it is as well to remark
that his Alcmena is equal to any that was ever produced.</p>
<p>Lycius was the son and pupil of Myron: he made a figure
representing a boy blowing a nearly extinguished fire, well
worthy of his master, as also figures of the Argonauts. Leochares
made a bronze representing the eagle carrying off
Ganymede:<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a> the eagle has all the appearance of being sensible
of the importance of his burden, and for whom he is
carrying it, being careful not to injure the youth with his
talons, even through the garments.</p>
<p>Theodorus of Samos,<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a> who constructed the Labyrinth at
Crete, cast his own statue in bronze, which was greatly
admired not only for its resemblance, but for the extreme
delicacy of the work. In the right hand he holds a file, and
with three fingers of the left, a little model of a four-horse
chariot, which has since been transferred to Pr&aelig;neste: it is so
extremely minute, that the whole piece, both chariot and
charioteer, may be covered by the wings of a fly, which he
also made with it.</p>
<p>The most celebrated of all the works, of which I have here
spoken, were dedicated, some time ago, by the Emperor Vespasianus
in the Temple of Peace, and other public buildings
of his. They had before been forcibly carried off by Nero,
brought to Rome, and placed by him in the reception-rooms
of his Golden Palace. There is one other famous statue, the
author unknown, which should not be omitted here,&mdash;that of
Hercules clothed in the poisoned tunic; it stands near the
Rostra, and the countenance is stern and expressive of his
last agonies, caused by that dress. There are three inscriptions
on it; the first of which states that it had formed part
of the spoil obtained by Lucullus the general, in his war
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
against Mithridates; the second, that his son, while still a
minor, dedicated it in accordance with a decree of the Senate;
the third, that Septimius Sabinus, the curule &aelig;dile, had it restored
to the public from the hands of a private individual.
So vast has been the rivalry caused by this statue, and so
high the value set upon it.</p>
<h2 id="c112"><span class="large">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />IRON.</h2>
<p>Next to copper comes the metal known as iron, at the
same time the most useful and the most fatal instrument in
the hand of mankind. For by the aid of iron we lay open the
ground, we plant trees, we prepare our vineyards, and we
force our vines each year to resume their youthful state, by
cutting away their decayed branches. It is by the aid of iron
that we construct houses, cleave rocks, and perform so many
other useful offices of life. But it is with iron also that wars,
murders, and robberies are effected, and this, not only hand
to hand, but from a distance even, by the aid of missiles and
winged weapons, now launched from engines, now hurled by
the human arm, and now furnished with feathery wings. The
last I regard as the most criminal artifice that has been
devised by the human mind; for, as if to bring death upon
man with still greater rapidity, we have given wings to iron
and taught it to fly.<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a> Let us therefore acquit Nature of a
charge that here belongs to man himself.</p>
<p>In the treaty which Porsena granted to the Roman people,
after the expulsion of the kings, we find it expressly stipulated,
that iron shall be only employed for the cultivation of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
fields; and our oldest authors inform us, that in those days it
was considered unsafe to write with an iron pen, or stylus.</p>
<p>Still human industry has not failed to employ iron for
perpetuating the honors of more civilized life. The artist
Aristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamas subsiding
into repentance, after he had thrown his son Learchus from
the rock, blended copper and iron, in order that the blush of
shame might be more exactly expressed, by the rust of the
iron making its appearance through the shining substance of
the copper; a statue which still exists at Rhodes. There is
also, in the same city, a Hercules of iron, executed by Alcon,
the endurance displayed by the god in his labors having suggested
the idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of iron consecrated
in the Temple of Mars the Avenger. Nature, in
conformity with her usual benevolence, has limited the power
of iron, by inflicting upon it the punishment of rust; and has
thus displayed her usual foresight in rendering that substance
the most perishable, which brings the greatest dangers upon
perishable mortality.</p>
<p>Iron ores are to be found almost everywhere. But of all
the different kinds the palm of excellence is awarded to
that which is made by the Seres, who send it to us with their
tissues and skins; next to which, in quality, is the Parthian
iron. None of the other kinds of iron are made of the pure
hard metal, a softer alloy being welded with them all. In
our part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionally found to
yield a metal of this high quality, as in Noricum, but in other
cases, it derives its value from the mode of working it.</p>

<br />AN ACCOUNT OF PAINTINGS AND COLORS.</h2>
<p>I cannot conclude what I have to say about art and artists
without some reference to painting, an art which was formerly
illustrious, when it was held in esteem both by kings and
peoples, and ennobled those whom it deigned to transmit to
posterity. But at the present day, it is completely banished
in favor of marble, and gold. For not only are whole walls
now covered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out
or marqueted so as to represent objects and animals of various
kinds. No longer now are we satisfied with formal compartitions
of marble, or with slabs extended like so many
mountains in our chambers, but we must begin to paint the
very stone itself! This art was invented in the reign of
Claudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered
the method of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to
it, and so varying its uniformity; representing the marble of
Numidia variegated with ovals, and that of Synnada veined
with purple; just as luxury might have willed that Nature
should produce them. Such are our resources when the
quarries fail us, and luxury ceases not to busy itself, in order
that as much as possible may be lost whenever a conflagration
happens.</p>
<p>Correct portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted
to later ages by painting; but instead brazen shields are now
set up, and silver faces, with only some obscure traces of the
countenance: the very heads, too, of statues are changed, a
thing that has given rise before now to many a current sarcastic
line; so true it is that people prefer showing off the
valuable material, to having a faithful likeness. Yet, at the
same time, we tapestry the walls of our galleries with old
pictures, and we prize the portraits of strangers; while as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
those made in honor of ourselves, we esteem them only for
the value of the material, for some heir to break up and melt,
and so forestall the noose and slip-knot of the thief.</p>
<p>Far different was it in the days of our ancestors. Then
there were to be seen in their halls not statues made by foreign
artists, or works in bronze or marble, but family portraits
modelled in wax, each in its separate niche, always in readiness
to accompany the funeral processions of the family;
occasions on which every member of the family was always
present. And the pedigree of the individual was traced in
lines upon each of these colored portraits. Their libraries,
too, were filled with archives and memoirs, stating what each
had done when holding the magistracy. On the outside,
again, of their houses, and around the thresholds of their
doors, were placed other statues of those mighty spirits, in
the spoils of the enemy there affixed, memorials which a purchaser
even was not allowed to displace; so that the very
house continued to triumph even after it had changed its
master. A powerful stimulus to emulation this, when the
walls each day reproached an unwarlike owner for having
thus intruded upon the triumphs of another! There is still
extant an address by the orator Messala, full of indignation,
in which he forbids that there should be inserted among the
images of his family any of those of the stranger race of the
L&aelig;vini. It was the same feeling, too, that extorted from old
Messala those compilations of his &ldquo;On the Families of
Rome;&rdquo; when, upon passing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus,
he observed that, in consequence of a testamentary
adoption, the Salvittos&mdash;for that had been their surname&mdash;to
the disgrace of the Africani, had surreptitiously contrived to
assume the name of the Scipios. But the Messalas must pardon
me if I remark, that to lay a claim, though an untruthful
one, to the statues of illustrious men, shows some love for
their virtues, and is much more honorable than to have such a
character that no one should wish to claim them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>There is a new invention, too, which we must not omit to
notice. Not only do we consecrate in our libraries, in gold
or silver, or at all events, in bronze, those whose immortal
spirits hold converse with us in those places, but we even go
so far as to reproduce the ideal of features all remembrance
of which has ceased to exist; and our regrets give existence
to likenesses that have not been transmitted to us, as in the
case of Homer. Nothing can be a greater proof of having
achieved success in life, than a lasting desire on the part of
one&rsquo;s fellow-men, to know what one&rsquo;s features were. This
practice of grouping portraits was first introduced at Rome
by Asinius Pollio, who was also the first to establish a public
library, and so make the works of genius the property of the
public. Whether the kings of Alexandria and of Pergamus,
who had so energetically rivalled each other in forming libraries,
had previously introduced this practice, I cannot so
easily say.</p>
<p>That a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, is
attested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote a
work on this subject, and by Varro, who conceived the very
liberal idea of inserting, by some means or other, in his
numerous volumes, the portraits of seven hundred individuals;
as he could not bear the idea that all traces of their
features should be lost, or that the lapse of centuries should
get the better of mankind. Thus was he the inventor of a
benefit to his fellow-men, that might have been envied by the
gods themselves; for not only did he confer upon them
immortality, but he transmitted them to all parts of the earth;
so that it might be possible for them to be present, everywhere
and each occupy his niche. This service Varro conferred
upon persons who were not members of his own family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<h2 id="c114"><span class="large">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />THE EARLIEST PAINTERS.</h2>
<p>We have no certain knowledge as to the commencement
of the art of painting. The Egyptians assert that it was invented
among themselves, six thousand years before it passed
into Greece; a vain boast&mdash;evidently. As to the Greeks,
some say that it was invented at Sicyon, others at Corinth;
but they all agree that it originated in tracing lines round the
human shadow. The first stage of the art was this, the
second the employment of single colors; a process known as
&ldquo;monochrome-painting.&rdquo; The invention of line-drawing has
been assigned to Philocles, the Egyptian, or to Cleanthes of
Corinth. The first who practised this line-drawing were Aridices,
the Corinthian, and Telephanes, the Sicyonian, artists
who, without making use of any colors, shaded the interior of
the outline by drawing lines; hence, it was the custom with
them to add to the picture the name of the person represented.
Ecphantus, the Corinthian, was the first to employ
colors upon these pictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware,
reduced to powder.</p>
<p>But already had the art of painting been perfectly developed
in Italy. At all events, there are extant in the temples
at Ardea, at this day, paintings of greater antiquity than
Rome itself; in which, in my opinion, nothing is more marvellous,
than that they should have remained so long unprotected
by a roof, and yet preserving their freshness. At
Lanuvium we see an Atalanta and a Helena, without drapery,
close together, and painted by the same artist. They are
both of the greatest beauty, the former being evidently the
figure of a virgin, and they still remain uninjured, though the
temple is in ruins. The Emperor Caligula attempted to have
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
them removed to his own palace, but the nature of the plaster
would not admit of it. There are in existence at C&aelig;re, some
paintings of a still higher antiquity. Whoever carefully
examines them, will be forced to admit that no art has arrived
more speedily at perfection, seeing that it evidently was not
in existence at the time of the Trojan War.</p>
<p>Among the Romans this art very soon rose into esteem,
the Fabii, a most illustrious family, deriving from it their
surname of &ldquo;Pictor;&rdquo; the first of the family who bore it,
himself painted the Temple of Health, in the year of the City,
450; a work which lasted to our own times, but was destroyed
when the temple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius.
Next in celebrity were the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, in
the Temple of Hercules, in the Cattle Market: he was a son
of the sister of Ennius, and the fame of the art was enhanced
at Rome by the success of this artist on the stage. After
this period, the art was no longer practised by men of rank;
unless we except Turpilius, in our own times, a native of
Venetia, and of equestrian rank, several of whose beautiful
works are still in existence at Verona. He painted, too, with
his left hand, a thing never known to have been done by any
one before.<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a></p>
<p>Titidius Labeo, a person of pr&aelig;torian rank, who had been
formerly proconsul of the province of Gallia Narbonensis,
and who lately died at a very advanced age, used to pride
himself upon the little pictures which he executed, but it only
caused him to be ridiculed and sneered at. I must not omit
to mention a celebrated consultation upon the subject of
painting, which was held by some persons of the highest rank.
Q. Pedius, who had been honored with the consulship and a
triumph, and who had been named by the Dictator C&aelig;sar as
co-heir with Augustus, had a grandson, dumb from his birth,
whom the orator Messala, to whose family his grandmother
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
belonged, recommended to be brought up as a painter. He
died, however, in his youth, after having made great progress
in the art. But the high estimation in which painting came
to be held at Rome, was principally due, in my opinion, to
Valerius Maximus Messala, who, in the year of the City, 490,
was the first to exhibit a painting to the public; a picture,
namely, of the battle in which he had defeated the Carthaginians
and Hiero in Sicily, upon one side of the Curia Hostilia.
The same thing was done, too, by Lucius Scipio, who placed
in the Capitol a painting of the victory which he had gained
in Asia; but his brother Africanus was offended at it, for his
son had been taken prisoner in the battle. Lucius Hostilius
Mancinus, who had been the first to enter Carthage at the
final attack, gave a similar offence to &AElig;milianus, by exposing
in the Forum a painting of that city and the attack upon it,
he himself standing near the picture, and describing to the
spectators the various details of the siege; a piece of complaisance
which secured him the consulship at the ensuing
Comitia.</p>
<p>The stage which was erected for the games celebrated by
Claudius Pulcher, brought the art of painting into great
admiration, for the ravens were so deceived by the resemblance,
as to light upon the decorations which were painted
in imitation of tiles.</p>
<p>The late Emperor Augustus placed in the most conspicuous
part of his forum, two pictures, representing War and
Triumph. He also placed in the Temple of his father,
C&aelig;sar, a picture of the Castors, and one of Victory, in addition
to those which we shall mention in our account of the
works of the different artists. He also inserted two pictures
in the wall of the Curia which he consecrated in the Comitium,
one of which was a Nemea seated upon a lion, and
bearing a palm in her hand. Close to her is an old man,
standing with a staff, and above his head hangs the picture of
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
a chariot with two horses. Nicias has written upon this
picture that he &ldquo;inburned&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a> it.</p>
<p>In the second picture the thing to be chiefly admired is the
resemblance that the youth bears to the old man his father,
allowing, of course, for the difference in age; above them
soars an eagle, which grasps a dragon in its talons. Philochares
attests that he is the author of this work, an instance,
if we only consider it, of the mighty power wielded by the
pictorial art; for here, thanks to Philochares, the senate of
the Roman people, age after age, has before its eyes Glaucion
and his son Aristippus, persons who would otherwise have
been altogether unknown.</p>
<p>Cimon of Cleon&aelig; first invented foreshortenings, or in other
words, oblique views of the figure, and first learned to vary
the features by representing them in the various attitudes of
looking backwards, upwards, or downwards. It was he, too,
who first marked the articulations of the limbs, indicated the
veins, and gave the natural folds and sinuosities to drapery.
Pan&aelig;nus, the brother of Phidias, even executed a painting of
the battle fought by the Athenians with the Persians at Marathon:
and so common had the employment of colors become,
and to such a state of perfection had the art arrived, that he
was able to represent the portraits of the various generals
who commanded at that battle, Miltiades, Callimachus, and
Cyn&aelig;girus, on the side of the Athenians, and, on that of the
barbarians, Datis and Artaphernes.</p>
<p>Polygnotus of Thasos was the first to paint the figures of
women in transparent drapery, and to represent the head
covered with a parti-colored head-dress. He, too, was the
first to contribute many other improvements to the art of
painting, opening the mouth, for example, showing the teeth,
and throwing expression into the countenance, in place of the
ancient rigidity of the features.</p>

<h2 id="c115"><span class="large">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />ARTISTS WHO PAINTED WITH THE PENCIL.</h2>
<p>In the ninetieth Olympiad lived Aglaophon, Cephisodorus,
Erillus, and Evenor, the father of Parrhasius, one of the
greatest of painters, and of whom we shall have to speak
when we come to the period at which he flourished. All
these were artists of note, but not sufficiently so to detain us
by any further details, in our haste to arrive at the luminaries
of the art; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens,
in the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paint
objects as they really appeared; the first too, we may justly
say, to confer glory by the aid of the pencil.<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a> Of this artist
there is a Priest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Lightning,
a work to be seen at Pergamus at the present day:
before him, there is no painting of any artist now to be seen
which has the power of riveting the eye.</p>
<p>The gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus,
Zeuxis of Heraclea entered upon the scene, in the fourth year
of the ninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil, for
which there was nothing too arduous, to a very high pitch of
glory. Of him Apollodorus wrote a verse to the effect, that
Zeuxis had stolen the art from others and had taken it all to
himself. Zeuxis also acquired such a vast amount of wealth,
that, in a spirit of ostentation, he went so far as to parade
himself at Olympia with his name embroidered on the
checked pattern of his garments in letters of gold. At a later
period, he came to the determination to give away his works,
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
there being no price high enough to pay for them, he said.
He gave an Alcmena to the people of Agrigentum, and a
Pan to Archela&uuml;s, King of Macedonia. He also painted a
Penelope, in which the peculiar character of that matron
appears to be delineated to the very life; and a figure of an
athlete, with which he was so highly pleased, that he wrote
beneath it the line which has since become so famous, to the
effect that it would be easier to find fault with him than to
imitate him.<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a> His Jupiter seated on the throne, with the
other Deities standing around him, is a magnificent production:
as, also, is his Infant Hercules strangling the Dragons,
in presence of Amphitryon and his mother Alcmena, who
is struck with horror. Still, however, Zeuxis is generally censured
for making the heads and articulations of his figures
out of proportion. And yet, so scrupulously careful was he,
that on one occasion, when he was about to execute a painting
for the people of Agrigentum, to be consecrated in the
Temple of the Lacinian Juno there, he had the young maidens
of the place stripped for examination, and selected five of
them as models, in order to adopt in his picture the most
commendable points in the form of each. He also painted
some monochromes in white.</p>
<p>The contemporaries and rivals of Zeuxis were Timanthes,
Androcydes, Eupompus, and Parrhasius. The last, it is said,
entered into a pictorial contest with Zeuxis, who represented
some grapes painted so naturally that the birds flew towards
the spot where the picture was exhibited. Parrhasius, on the
other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn with such singular
truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the judgment which had
been passed upon his work by the birds, haughtily demanded
that the curtain should be drawn aside to let the picture be
seen. Upon finding his mistake, with a great degree of ingenuous
candor he admitted that he had been surpassed, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
while he himself had only deceived the birds, Parrhasius had
deceived him, an artist.</p>
<p>There is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis painted
a child carrying grapes, and the birds came to peck at them:
upon which, with a similar degree of candor, he expressed
himself vexed with his work, and exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;I have surely
painted the grapes better than the child, for if I had fully
succeeded in the latter, the birds would have been in fear of
it.&rdquo; Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay, the only
works of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when Fulvius
Nobilior transported the Muses from that city to Rome.
There is at Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of
Philippus, and a Marsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord
there.</p>
<p>Parrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the progress
of painting, being the first to give symmetry to his
figures, the first to give play and expression to the features,
elegance to the hair, and gracefulness to the mouth: indeed,
for contour, it is universally admitted by artists that he bore
away the palm. This, in painting, is the very highest point
of skill. To paint substantial bodies and the interior of
objects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time it is a
point in which many have excelled: but to make the extreme
outline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to the
painting in rounding off the contour, this is a point of success
in the art which is but rarely attained. For the extreme outline,
to be properly executed, requires to be nicely rounded,
and so to terminate as to prove the existence of something
more behind it, and thereby disclose that which it also serves
to hide.</p>
<p>Such is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus and
Xenocrates, who have written on the art of painting; and in
this as well as in other points, not only do they admit his
excellence, but enlarge upon it in terms of the highest commendation.
There are many pen sketches by him still in
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
existence, both upon panel and on parchment, from the study
of which, even artists may greatly profit.</p>
<p>In his allegorical picture of the People of Athens, he has
displayed singular ingenuity in the treatment of his subjects;
for in representing it, he had to depict it as at once fickle,
choleric, unjust, and versatile; while, again, he had equally
to show its attributes of implacability and clemency, compassionateness
and pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and
timidity&mdash;and all these at once. He painted a Theseus also,
which was formerly in the Capitol at Rome, a Naval Commander
wearing a cuirass, and, in one picture, now at Rhodes,
figures of Meleager, Hercules, and Perseus. This last painting,
though it has been thrice struck by lightning, has escaped
being effaced, a circumstance which tends to augment
the admiration which it naturally excites. He painted an
Archigallus<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a> also, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius
greatly admired. According to Deculo, that prince had it
shut up in his chamber, the price at which it was valued being
six hundred thousand sesterces.</p>
<p>Parrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infant
in her arms, a Philiscus, a Father Liber attended by Virtue,
Two Children, in which we see portrayed the careless simplicity
of childhood, and a Priest attended by a Boy, with a
censer and chaplet. There are also two most noble pictures
by him; one of which represents a Runner contending for the
prize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that he appears
covered with perspiration. In the other we see the
Runner taking off his armor, and can fancy that we hear him
panting aloud for breath. His &AElig;neas, Castor, and Pollux,
all represented in the same picture, are highly praised, as well
as his Telephus, Achilles, Agamemnon, and Ulysses.</p>
<p>Parrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same time
there was no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him
by his talent with greater arrogance. He went so far as
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
to call himself &ldquo;Habrodi&aelig;tus&rdquo; (Liver-in-Luxury), and the
&ldquo;prince of painters,&rdquo; and asserted that in him the art had
arrived at perfection. He boasted that he had sprung from
the lineage of Apollo, and that he had painted his Hercules,
a picture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him in his
sleep. Upon being defeated by Timanthes, at Samos, by a
great majority of votes, the subject of the picture being Ajax
and the Award of the Arms,<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a> he declared in the name of his
hero, that he felt himself quite disgraced on thus seeing himself
a second time defeated by an unworthy opponent.</p>
<p>As to Timanthes, he was an artist highly gifted with
genius, and loud have some of the orators been in their commendations
of his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at the
altar awaiting her doom. Upon the countenance of all present,
that of her uncle Menelaus in particular, grief was depicted;
but having already exhausted all the characteristic
features of sorrow, the artist adopted the device of veiling
the features of the victim&rsquo;s father, Agamemnon, finding himself
unable adequately to give expression to his feelings.
There are also some other proofs of his genius, a Sleeping
Cyclops, for instance, which he has painted upon a small
panel; but, being desirous to convey an idea of his gigantic
stature, he has painted some Satyrs near him measuring his
thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthes is the only one
among the artists in whose works there is always something
more implied by the pencil than is expressed, and whose execution,
though of the very highest quality, is always surpassed
by the inventiveness of his genius. He painted the figure of a
Hero, a master-piece of skill, in which he carried the art to
the very highest pitch of perfection, in the delineation of the
warrior: this work is now at Rome, in the Temple of Peace.</p>
<p>At this period, too, Euxinidas had for his pupil Aristides,
who became a most illustrious artist; and Eupompus instructed
Pamphilus, who afterwards became the instructor of
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
Apelles. There is by Eupompus, a Victor in a gymnastic
contest, holding a palm. So high was the reputation of this
artist, that he established a school of painting, and so divided
the art into three styles; whereas till then there had been but
two, known respectively as the Helladic and the Asiatic. In
honor of him, a native of Sicyon by birth, the Helladic school
was divided into two, and from this period there were three
distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, the Sicyonian, and the
Attic.</p>
<p>We have, by Pamphilus, a picture representing the Alliance
and the Battle that was fought at Phlius; a Victory also
and a representation of Ulysses in his ship. He was a Macedonian
by birth, but was the first painter who was also skilled
in all the other sciences, arithmetic and geometry more particularly,
without the aid of which he maintained that the
pictorial art could not attain perfection. He gave instruction
to no one for a smaller sum than one talent, at the rate of
five hundred denarii per annum,<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> and this fee both Apelles
and Melanthius paid. It was through his influence that, first
at Sicyon, and then throughout the whole of Greece, all children
of free birth were taught the graphic art, or in other
words, the art of drawing upon boxwood; in consequence of
which this came to be looked upon as the first step in the liberal
arts. It is the fact, however, that this art has always
been held in high estimation, and cultivated by persons of
free birth, and that, at a more recent period, men of rank
even began to pursue it; it having always been forbidden
that slaves should receive instruction in it. Hence no celebrated
work of painting or drawing has been executed by a
slave.</p>
<p>In the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished A&euml;tion
and Therimachus. By the former we have some fine pictures;
a Father Liber, Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
the rank of a slave elevated to the throne, an Old Woman
bearing torches, and a New-made Bride, remarkable for the
air of modesty with which she is portrayed.</p>
<p>But it was Apelles of Cos, in the hundred and twelfth
Olympiad, who surpassed all the other painters who either
preceded or succeeded him. Single-handed, he contributed
more to painting than all the others together, and even went
so far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art.
The great point of artistic merit with him was his singular
charm of gracefulness, and this too, though the greatest of
painters were his contemporaries. In admiring their works
and bestowing high eulogiums upon them, he used to say
that there was still wanting in them that ideal of beauty so
peculiar to himself, and known to the Greeks as &ldquo;Charis;&rdquo;
others, he said, had acquired all the other requisites of perfection,
but in this one point he himself had no equal. He
also asserted his claim to another great point of merit: admiring
a picture by Protogenes, which bore evident marks of
unbounded laboriousness and the most minute finish, he remarked
that in every respect Protogenes was fully his equal,
or perhaps his superior, except in this, that he himself knew
when to take his hand off a picture&mdash;a memorable lesson,
which teaches us that over-carefulness may be productive of
bad results. His candor was equal to his talent; he acknowledged
the superiority of Melanthius in his grouping, and of
Asclepiodorus in the niceness of his measurements, or, in
other words, the distances that ought to be left between the
objects represented.</p>
<p>A circumstance that happened to him in connection with
Protogenes is worthy of notice. The latter was living at
Rhodes, when Apelles disembarked there, desirous of seeing
the works of a man whom he had hitherto only known by
reputation. He repaired at once to the studio; Protogenes
was not at home, but there happened to be a large panel
upon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman who
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
was left in charge. To his inquiries she made answer, that
Protogenes was not at home, and then asked whom she
should name as the visitor. &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; was the reply of
Apelles, and seizing a brush, he traced with color upon the
panel an outline of a singularly minute fineness. Upon his
return, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what had
happened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacy
of the touch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been
the visitor, for that no other person was capable of executing
anything so exquisitely perfect. So saying, he traced within
the same outline a still finer outline, but with another color,
and then took his departure, with instructions to the woman
to show it to the stranger, if he returned, and to let him know
that this was the person whom he had come to see. It happened
as he anticipated; Apelles returned, and vexed at finding
himself thus surpassed, took up another color and split<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a>
both of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer
being executed. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that
he was defeated, and at once flew to the harbor to look for
his guest. He thought proper to transmit the panel to posterity,
just as it was, and it always continued to be held in the
highest admiration by all, artists in particular. I am told
that it was burnt in the first fire which took place at C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
palace on the Palatine Hill; but in former times I have often
stopped to admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained
nothing whatever except the three outlines, so remarkably
fine as to escape the sight: among the most elaborate works
of numerous other artists it had all the appearance of a blank
space; and yet by that very fact it attracted the notice of
every one, and was held in higher estimation than any other
painting there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>It was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously
adhered, never to let any day pass, however busy he might
be, without exercising himself by tracing some outline or
other; a practice which has now passed into a proverb.<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a> It
was also a practice with him, when he had completed a work,
to exhibit it to the view of the passers-by in some exposed
place; while he himself, concealed behind the picture, would
listen to the criticisms that were passed upon it; it being his
opinion that the judgment of the public was preferable to his
own, as being the more discerning of the two. It was under
these circumstances, they say, that he was censured by a
shoemaker for having represented the shoes with one shoe-string
too little. The next day, the shoemaker, quite proud
at seeing the former error corrected, thanks to his advice,
began to criticise the leg; upon which Apelles, full of indignation,
popped his head out, and reminded him that a shoemaker
should give no opinion beyond the shoes, a piece of
advice which has passed into an equally proverbial saying.<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a>
Apelles was a person of great amenity of manners, a circumstance
which rendered him particularly agreeable to Alexander
the Great, who would often come to his studio. The
monarch had forbidden, by public edict, that any other artist
should represent him. On one occasion, however, when the
prince was in his studio, talking a great deal about painting
without knowing anything about it, Apelles quietly begged
that he would quit the subject, telling him that he would get
laughed at by the boys who were there grinding the colors:
so great was the influence which he rightfully possessed over
a monarch, who was otherwise of an irascible temperament.
And yet, irascible as he was, Alexander conferred upon him
a very signal mark of the high estimation in which he held
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
him; for having, in his admiration of her extraordinary
beauty, engaged Apelles to paint Pancaste undraped, the
most beloved of his wives, the artist, while so engaged, fell
in love with her; upon which, Alexander, perceiving this to
be the case, made him a present of her, thus showing himself,
though a great king in courage, a still greater one in
self-command, this action redounding no less to his honor
than any of his victories. Some are of opinion that Pancaste
was the model of Apelles in his painting of Venus rising from
the waters.</p>
<p>It was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, first
established the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held
as he was in little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen,
a thing that generally<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> is the case, Apelles inquired of him
what price he set upon certain finished works of his, which
he had on hand. Upon Protogenes mentioning some very
trifling sum or other, Apelles made him an offer of fifty talents,
and then circulated a report that he was buying these
works in order to sell them as his own. By this contrivance,
he aroused the Rhodians to a better appreciation of the merits
of their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures
with them upon their offering a still larger price.</p>
<p>He painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a fact
with which we are made acquainted by the writings of Apion
the grammarian seems altogether incredible. One of those
persons, he says, who divine events by the traits of the features,
and are known as physiognomists, was enabled, by an
examination of his portraits, to tell the year of their death,
whether past or future, of each person represented. Apelles
had been on bad terms with Ptolem&aelig;us in former times, when
they formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptolem&aelig;us
had become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apelles was
driven by the violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
this, some of his rivals fraudulently suborned a jester, who
was attached to the court, to carry him an invitation to dine
with the king. Accordingly, Apelles attended; upon which
Ptolem&aelig;us was highly indignant, and, summoning before him
his stewards of the household, requested that the artist would
point out the one that had given him the invitation. Thus
challenged, Apelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that
lay in the fire-place, and traced a likeness upon the wall, with
such exactness, that the king, the moment he began it, recognized
the features as those of the jester.</p>
<p>He also made a portrait of King Antigonus; and as that
monarch was blind of one eye, he painted him in profile, in
order that what in reality was wanting to the person might
rather have the semblance of being wanting to the picture.
Among his works, too, there are some figures representing
persons at the point of death; but it is not easy to say which
of his productions are of the highest order of excellence.
His Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus
Anadyomene, was consecrated by the late Emperor Augustus
in the Temple of his father C&aelig;sar; a work which has
been celebrated in certain Greek lines, which, though they
have outlived it, have perpetuated its fame. The lower part
of the picture having become damaged, no one could be
found to repair it; and thus did the very injury which the
picture had sustained, redound to the glory of the artist.
Time, however, and damp at last effaced the painting, and
Nero, in his reign, had it replaced by a copy, painted by the
hand of Dorotheus. Apelles also commenced another Venus
for the people of Cos, which would have outshone even the
former one; but death invidiously prevented its completion,
nor could any one be found to complete the work in conformity
with the sketches of the outline. He painted also,
in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, Alexander the Great
wielding the Thunderbolts, a picture for which he received
twenty talents of gold. The fingers have all the appearance
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
of projecting from the surface, and the lightning seems to be
darting from the picture. The price paid in golden coin for
this picture was ascertained by weight, there being no specific
sum agreed upon.</p>
<p>He also painted a Procession of the Megabyzus, the priest
of Diana at Ephesus; and a Clitus on Horseback, hastening
to the combat, his Armor-bearer handing him his helmet at
his command. How many times he painted Alexander and
Philip, it would be quite superfluous to attempt to enumerate.
At Samos, there is a Habron by him, that is greatly admired;
at Alexandria, a Gorgosthenes, the Tragedian; and at Rome,
a Castor and Pollux, with figures of Victory and Alexander
the Great, and an emblematical figure of War with her hands
tied behind her, and Alexander seated in a triumphal car;
both of which pictures the late Emperor Augustus, with a
great degree of moderation and good taste, consecrated in
the most frequented parts of his Forum: the Emperor Claudius,
however, thought it advisable to efface the head of
Alexander in both pictures, and substitute likenesses of his
predecessor Augustus. It is by his hand too, it is generally
supposed, that the Hercules, with the face averted, now in
the Temple of Anna, was painted; a picture in which, one of
the greatest difficulties in the art, the face, though hidden,
may be said to be seen rather than left to the imagination.
He also painted a figure of a naked Hero, a picture in which
he has challenged Nature herself.</p>
<p>There exists too, or did exist, a Horse that was painted by
him for a pictorial contest; as to the merits of which, Apelles
appealed from the judgment of his fellow-men to that of the
dumb quadrupeds. For, finding that by their intrigues his
rivals were likely to get the better of him, he had some horses
brought, and the picture of each artist successively shown to
them. Only at the sight of the horse painted by Apelles did
they begin to neigh; a thing that has always been the case
since, whenever this test of his artistic skill has been employed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
He also painted a Neoptolemus on horse-back,
fighting with the Persians; an Archel&auml;us, with his Wife and
Daughter; and an Antigonus on foot, with a cuirass on, and
his horse led by his side. Connoisseurs in the art give the
preference, before all other works of his, to his paintings of
King Archel&auml;us on horseback, and of Diana in the midst of
a throng of Virgins performing a sacrifice; a work in which
he would appear to have surpassed the lines<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a> of Homer
descriptive of the same subject. He also essayed some
things, which in reality do not admit of being portrayed&mdash;thunder,
lightning, and thunderbolts, in pictures which are
known by the respective names of Bronte, Astrape, and
Ceraunobolia.</p>
<p>His inventions, too, in the art of painting, have been highly
serviceable to others; but one thing there was in which no
one could imitate him. When his works were finished, he
used to cover them with a black varnish, of such remarkable
thinness, that while it gave more vivacity to the colors, and
preserved them from the contact of dust and dirt, its existence
could only be detected when one was close enough to
touch it.<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a> The brightness of the colors was softened and
harmonized to the sight, as though they had been viewed
from a distance, and through a medium of specular-stone, the
contrivance, by some indescribable means, giving a sombreness
to colors which would otherwise have been too florid.</p>
<p>One of the contemporaries of Apelles was Aristides of
Thebes; the first of all the painters to give full expression to
the mind and passions of man, known to the Greeks as <span title="&ecirc;th&ecirc;" class="g">&eta;&theta;&eta;</span>.
He painted a Battle with the Persians, a picture which contained
one hundred figures, for each of which he was paid at
the rate of ten min&aelig; by Mnason, the tyrant of Elatea. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
also painted Chariots with four horses in full career; a Suppliant,
which almost speaks; Huntsmen with game; and a
damsel pining to death from love for her brother. There
was also to be seen, in the Temple of Faith, in the Capitol,
a picture of his, representing an Aged Man giving instructions
to a Child on the lyre. He executed also a painting of
an Invalid, upon which endless encomiums have been lavished.
Indeed, so great was the excellence of this artist,
that King Attalus is said to have purchased one picture of
his at the price of one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>At the same period flourished Protogenes, native of Caunus,
a place held in subjection by the Rhodians. Great poverty
in his early days, and extreme application to his art,
were the causes of his comparative unproductiveness. It is
not known with certainty from whom he received his instruction
in the art: indeed some say that he was only a ship-decorator
down to his fiftieth year; a proof of which, it is
asserted, is the fact, that in decorating the Propyl&aelig;um of the
Temple of Minerva, situated in one of the most celebrated
spots in Athens, where he has painted the fine picture of
Paralus and Hammonias, known by some as the Nausicaa,
he has added in the side pieces of the picture, by painters
called &ldquo;parerga,&rdquo; several small ships of war; wishing thereby
to show in what department that skill had first manifested
itself which had thus reached the citadel of Athens, the scene
of his glory. Of all his compositions, however, the palm has
been awarded to his Ialysus, grandson of Apollo, now at
Rome, consecrated in the Temple of Peace. So long as he
was at work upon it, he lived upon nothing but soaked lupines;
by which means he at once appeased both hunger and
thirst, and avoided all risk of blunting his perception by too
delicate a diet. In order to protect this picture against the
effects of ill-usage and old age, he painted it over four times,
so that when an upper coat might fail, there would be an
under one to succeed it. There is in this picture the figure
<span class="pb" id="Page_310">310</span>
of a dog, which was completed in a very remarkable manner,
inasmuch as accident had an equal share with design in the
execution of it. The painter was of opinion that he had not
given the proper expression to the foam at the mouth of
the animal, panting for breath, as it was represented; while,
with all other parts of the picture he was perfectly satisfied,
a thing extremely unusual with him. The thing that displeased
him was, the evident traces of art in the execution of
it, touches which did not admit of any diminution, and yet
had all the appearance of being too labored, the effect
produced being far removed from his conception of the reality&mdash;the
foam bore the marks of being painted, and not
natural. Vexed and tormented by this dilemma, it being his
wish to depict truth itself, and not something that only bore
a semblance of truth, he effaced it again and again, changed
one brush for another, and yet by no possibility could satisfy
himself. At last, quite out of temper with an art, which, in
spite of him, would still obtrude itself, he dashed his sponge
against the vexatious spot; when behold! the sponge replaced
the colors that it had just removed, exactly in accordance
with his utmost wishes. Thus did chance reproduce
Nature in a painting.</p>
<p>Following his example, Nealces succeeded in representing
the foam at a horse&rsquo;s mouth; for on one occasion, when engaged
in painting a man holding in a pair of horses and soothing
them with his voice, he also dashed his sponge against
the picture, with the view of producing a like effect.</p>
<p>On account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehensive of
destroying, King Demetrius forbore to set fire to the only
side of the city of Rhodes by which it was capable of being
taken; and thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, did he lose
his only opportunity of gaining a victory. The dwelling of
Protogenes was in a little garden in the suburbs in the midst
of the camp of Demetrius. The combats that were taking
place made no difference whatever to the artist, and in no
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
way interrupted his proceeding with the work which he had
commenced. At last he was summoned before the king, who
inquired how he could have the assurance thus to remain
without the walls. &ldquo;Because I know,&rdquo; was his answer, &ldquo;that
you are waging war with the Rhodians, and not with the
arts.&rdquo; Upon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity
of protecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered
a guard to be placed at his disposal for the especial purpose
of his protection. In order, too, that he might not distract
the artist&rsquo;s attention by sending for him too often, he would
often go, an enemy albeit, to pay him a visit, and, abandoning
his aspirations for victory, in the midst of arms and the
battering down of walls, would attentively examine the compositions
of the painter. Even to this day, the story is still
attached to the picture which he was then engaged upon, to
the effect, that &ldquo;Protogenes painted it beneath the sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Protogenes executed also a Cydippe; a portrait of Philiscus,
the tragic poet, in an attitude of meditation: an Athlete;
a portrait of King Antigonus, and one of Ph&aelig;stis, the mother
of Aristotle.</p>
<h2 id="c116"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF PAINTING.</h2>
<p>We must now make some mention of those artists who
acquired fame by the pencil in an inferior style of painting.
Among these was Pir&aelig;icus, inferior to few of the painters in
skill. I am not sure that he did not do injustice to himself
by the choice of his subjects, seeing that, although he adopted
an humble walk, he still attained in that walk the highest
reputation. His subjects were barbers&rsquo; shops, cobblers&rsquo; stalls,
jackasses, eatables, and the like. His paintings, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at higher prices than
the very largest works of many masters.</p>
<p>It would not be right to pass in silence the painter of the
Temple at Ardea, particularly as he was honored with the
citizenship at that place, and with the following inscription in
verse upon one of the paintings which he executed there:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;These paintings, worthy of this worthy place,</p>
<p class="t0">Temple of Juno, queen, and wife of Jove,</p>
<p class="t0">Plautius Marcus, from Alalia, made.</p>
<p class="t0">May Ardea now and ever praise him for his skill.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These lines are written in ancient Latin characters.</p>
<p>Ludius too, who lived in the time of the late Emperor
Augustus, must not be allowed to pass without some notice;
for he was the first to introduce the fashion of covering the
walls of our houses with most pleasing landscapes, representing
villas, porticos, ornamental gardening, woods, groves,
hills, fishponds, canals, rivers, seashores, and anything else
one could desire; varied with figures of persons walking, sailing,
or proceeding to their villas, on asses or in carriages,
fishing, fowling, or gathering in the vintage. In some of his
decorations are fine villas and roads to them across the
marshes, with women making bargains, great burdens carried
across on men&rsquo;s shoulders, who move along slipping at every
step and tottering beneath their load; with numberless other
subjects of a similar nature, redolent of mirth and of the most
amusing ingenuity. It was this artist, too, who first decorated
our uncovered edifices or promenades with representations
of maritime cities,&mdash;a subject which produces a very
pleasing effect at a comparatively trifling cost.</p>
<p>There have been some women painters also. Timarete,
the daughter of Micon, painted a Diana at Ephesus, one of
the very oldest panel-paintings known. Irene, daughter and
pupil of the artist Cratinus, painted a figure of a girl, now at
Eleusis, a Calypso, an Aged Man, the juggler Theodorus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
and Alcisthenes the dancer. Aristarete, daughter and pupil
of Nearchus, painted an &AElig;sculapius. Iaia of Cyzicus, who
always remained single, painted at Rome, in the youth of
Varro, both with the brush, and with the graver, upon ivory,
her subjects being female portraits mostly. At Naples, there
is a large picture by her, the portrait of an Old Woman; as
also a portrait of herself taken by the aid of a mirror. There
was no painter superior to her for expedition; while at the
same time her artistic skill was such, that her works sold at
much higher prices than those of the most celebrated portrait-painters
of her day, Sopolis and Dionysius, with whose pictures
our galleries are filled.</p>
<p>But as for fame, that has been reserved solely for the artists
who have painted pictures; which gives us all the more
reason to venerate the prudence displayed by the men of
ancient times. For with them, it was not the practice to decorate
the walls of houses, for the gratification of the owners
only; nor did they lavish all their resources upon a dwelling
which must of necessity always remain a fixture in one spot,
and admit of no removal in case of conflagration. Protogenes
was content with a cottage in his little garden; Apelles
had no paintings on the plaster of his walls; it not being the
fashion in their day to color the party-walls of houses from
top to bottom. With all those artists, art was ever watchful
for the benefit of whole cities only, and in those times a
painter was regarded as the common property of all.</p>
<h2 id="c117"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />THE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING.</h2>
<p>On painting we have now said enough, and more than
enough; but it will be only proper to append some accounts
of the plastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in
the earth which he used in his trade. He made the discovery
through his daughter, who, being deeply in love with a young
man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of
his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp.
Upon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing
clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which
he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery.</p>
<p>Butades invented the method of coloring plastic compositions,
by adding red earth to the material, or else modelling
them in red chalk: he, too, was the first to make masks on
the outer edges of gutter-tiles upon the roofs of buildings; in
low relief, and in high relief. In these designs in terra cotta
the ornaments on the pediments of temples originated.</p>
<p>The first person who expressed the human features by fitting
a mould of plaster upon the face, and then improving it
by pouring melted wax into the cast, was Lysistratus of
Sicyon, brother of Lysippus, already mentioned. He first
made it his study to give a faithful likeness; for before his
time, artists only thought how to make their portraits as
handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was the first
who thought of making models for his statues; a method
which afterwards became so universally adopted, that there
could be neither figure nor statue made without its model in
clay. The art of modelling in clay thus appears to be more
ancient than that of moulding in bronze.</p>
<p>The most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gorgasus,
who were painters as well. These artists adorned with
their works, in both kinds, the Temple of Ceres, in the Circus
Maximus at Rome, with an inscription in Greek, which stated
that the decorations on the right-hand were the workmanship
of Damophilus, and those on the left, of Gorgasus. Varro
says that, before the construction of this temple, everything
was Tuscan in the temples; and that, when the temple was
afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
cut away in tablets and enclosed in frames, but that the figures
on the pediments were dispersed. Chalcosthenes executed
at Athens some works in unbaked earth, on the spot
which, from his manufactory, has since obtained the name of
&ldquo;Ceramicus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Varro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis by
name, who executed fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exactness,
that it was quite impossible, by looking at them, to distinguish
them from the reality. He speaks very highly also
of Arcesila&uuml;s, who was on terms of intimacy with Lucius
Lucullus, and whose models in plaster used to sell at a higher
rate, among artists themselves, than the works of others.
He informs us, also, that the Venus Genetrix in the Forum
of C&aelig;sar was executed by this modeller, and erected before
completion, in the great haste that there was to consecrate it.
The same artist had made an agreement with Lucullus to
execute a figure of Felicity, at the price of sixty thousand
sesterces, the completion of which was prevented by the
latter&rsquo;s death; and Octavius, a Roman of equestrian rank,
being desirous of a model for a mixing-bowl, Arcesila&uuml;s made
him one in plaster, at the price of one talent.</p>
<h2 id="c118"><span class="large">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />WORKS IN POTTERY.</h2>
<p>At Rome, and in our municipal towns, we still see many
pediments of temples, wonderful for their workmanship,
artistic merit and long duration, more deserving of our
respect than gold, and certainly far less baneful. At the
present day, even, in the midst of such wealth as we possess,
we make our first libation at the sacrifice, not from murrhine
vases or vessels of crystal, but from ladles made of earthenware.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>Bounteous beyond expression is the earth, if we consider in
detail her various gifts. To omit all mention of the cereals,
wine, fruits, herbs, shrubs, medicaments, and metals, bounties
which she has lavished upon us, and which have already
passed under our notice, her productions in the shape of pottery
alone would more than suffice, in their variety, to satisfy
our domestic wants; there are gutter-tiles of earthenware,
vats for receiving wine, pipes for conveying water, conduits
for supplying baths, baked tiles for roofs, bricks for foundations,
and the productions of the potter&rsquo;s wheel; results, all
of them, of an art, which induced King Numa to establish, as
a seventh college, or association, that of the makers of earthenware.</p>
<p>Many have chosen to be buried in coffins of earthenware.
There was Varro himself, who was interred, in true Pythagorean
style, in the midst of leaves of myrtle, olive, and black
poplar; indeed, the greater part of mankind make use of
earthen vases for this purpose. For the service of the table,
the Samian pottery is even yet held in high esteem; and that
of Arretium in Italy maintains its high character; while for
their cups, and for those only, the manufactories of Surrentum,
Asta, Pollentia, Saguntum in Spain, and Pergamus in
Asia, are greatly esteemed.</p>
<p>The city of Tralles in Asia, and Mutina in Italy, have their
respective manufactures of earthenware, and are rendered
famous by their productions from the potter&rsquo;s wheel, now
known to all countries, and conveyed by sea and by land to
every quarter of the earth. In a temple at Erythr&aelig; are still
shown two amphor&aelig;, that were consecrated in consequence of
the singular thinness of the material: they originated in a
contest between a master and his pupil, which of the two
could make earthenware of the greatest thinness. The vessels
of Cos are the most highly celebrated for their beauty,
but those of Adria are considered the most substantial.</p>
<p>Coponius was condemned for bribery, because he presented
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
a voter with an amphora of wine. To make luxury conduce
in some degree to enhance our estimation of earthenware,
&ldquo;tripatinium,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a> as we learn from Fenestella, was the name
given to the most exquisite course of dishes that was served
up at the Roman banquets. It consisted of one dish of
mur&aelig;n&aelig;, one of lupi, and a third of a mixture of fish. It is
clear that the public manners were then already on the
decline; though we still have a right to hold them preferable
to those of the philosophers even of Greece, seeing that the
representatives of Aristotle, it is said, sold, at the auction of
his goods, as many as seventy dishes of earthenware. It has
been already stated by us, when on the subject of birds, that
a single dish cost the tragic actor, &AElig;sopus, one hundred thousand
sesterces; much to the reader&rsquo;s indignation, no doubt;
but, by Hercules! Vitellius, when emperor, ordered a dish
to be made, which was to cost a million of sesterces, and for
the preparation of which a furnace had to be erected out in the
fields! luxury having thus arrived at such a pitch of excess as
to make earthenware even sell at higher prices than murrhine
vessels. Alluding to this circumstance, Mucianus, in his second
consulship, when pronouncing one of his perorations,
reproached the memory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad
as the Pomptine Marsh; not less deserving to be execrated
than the poisoned dish of Asprenas, which, according to the
accusation brought against him by Cassius Severus, caused
the death of one hundred and thirty guests.</p>
<p>What is there that human industry will not devise? Even
broken pottery has been utilized; for when beaten to powder,
and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and durable
than other substances of a similar nature; forming the cement
known as the &ldquo;Signine&rdquo; composition, so called from Signia,

<br />SCULPTURE.</h2>
<p>The art of sculpture is of much more ancient origin than
those of painting and of statuary in bronze. Phidias himself
worked in marble, and there is a Venus of his at Rome, a
work of extraordinary beauty, in the buildings of Octavia.
He was the instructor of Alcamenes, the Athenian, one of the
most famous among the sculptors. By this last artist, there
are numerous statues in the temples at Athens; as also, without
the walls there, the celebrated Venus, known as the
Aphrodite in the Gardens, a work to which Phidias himself,
it is said, put the finishing hand. Another disciple also of
Phidias was Agoracritus of Paros, a great favorite with his
master, on account of his extremely youthful age; and for
which reason, it is said, Phidias gave his own name to many
of that artist&rsquo;s works. The two pupils entering into a contest
as to the superior execution of a statue of Venus, Alcamenes
was successful; not that his work was superior, but because
his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in his favor in
preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, it is said,
that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express condition that
it should never be taken to Athens, and changed its name to
that of Nemesis. It was accordingly erected at Rhamnus, a
borough of Attica, and Varro has considered it superior to
every other statue.</p>
<p>Among all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiter
has reached, Phidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, as the
most famous of artists: but to let those who have never even
seen his works, know how deservedly he is esteemed, we will
take this opportunity of adducing a few slight proofs of the
genius which he displayed. In doing this, we shall not appeal
to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to the vast
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
proportions of his Athenian Minerva, six-and-twenty cubits in
height, and composed of ivory and gold; but to the shield of
this last statue we shall draw attention; upon the convex
face of which he has chased a combat of the Amazons, while,
upon the concave side of it, he has represented the battle
between the Gods and the Giants. Upon the sandals again,
we see the wars of the Lapith&aelig; and Centaurs, so careful has
he been to fill every smallest portion of his work with some
proof or other of his artistic skill. To the story chased upon
the pedestal of the statue, the name of the &ldquo;Birth of Pandora&rdquo;
has been given; and the figures of gods to be seen
upon it are no less than twenty in number. The figure of
Victory, in particular, is most admirable, and connoisseurs are
greatly struck with the serpent and the sphinx in bronze lying
beneath the point of the spear. Let so much be said incidentally
in reference to an artist who can never be sufficiently
praised; if only to let it be understood that the richness of
his genius was always equal to itself, even in the very smallest
details.</p>
<p>When speaking of the statuaries, we have already given
the period at which Praxiteles flourished; an artist, who, in
the glory which he acquired by his works in marble, surpassed
even himself. There are some works of his in the Ceramicus
at Athens; but, superior to all the statues, not only of Praxiteles,
but of any other artist that ever existed, is his Cnidian
Venus; for the inspection of which, many persons before now
have purposely undertaken a voyage to Cnidos. The artist
made two statues of the goddess, and offered them both for
sale: one of them was represented with drapery, and for this
reason was preferred by the people of Cos, who had the
choice; the second was offered them at the same price, but,
on the grounds of propriety and modesty, they thought fit to
choose the other. Upon this, the Cnidians purchased the
rejected statue, and immensely superior has it always been
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
held in general estimation.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a> At a later period, King Nicomedes
wished to purchase this statue of the Cnidians, and
made them an offer to pay off the whole of their public debt,
which was very large. They preferred, however, to submit to
any extremity rather than part with it; and with good reason,
for by this statue Praxiteles has perpetuated the glory of
Cnidos. The little temple in which it is placed is open on
all sides, so that the beauties of the statue admit of being
seen from every point of view; an arrangement which was
favored by the goddess herself, it is generally believed. Indeed,
from whatever point it is viewed, its execution is equally
worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Cephisodotus, the son of Praxiteles, inherited his father&rsquo;s
talent. There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group of
Wrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in which
the fingers have all the appearance of being impressed upon
real flesh rather than upon marble.</p>
<p>Scopas rivals these artists in fame: there is by him, a
Venus venerated at Samothrace with the most august ceremonials.
He was also the sculptor of the Palatine Apollo.
But the most highly esteemed of all his works, are those in
the Temple erected by Cneius Domitius, in the Flaminian
Circus; a figure of Neptune himself, a Thetis and Achilles,
Nereids seated upon dolphins, cetaceous fishes, and seahorses,
Tritons, the train of Phorcus, whales, and numerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
other sea-monsters, all by the same hand; an admirable piece
of workmanship, even if it had taken a whole life to complete
it. In addition to the works by him already mentioned, and
others of the existence of which we are ignorant, there is still
to be seen a colossal Mars of his, seated, in the Temple
erected by Brutus Call&aelig;cus, also in the Flaminian Circus; as
also, a naked Venus, of anterior date to that by Praxiteles,
and a production that would be quite sufficient to establish
the renown of any other place.</p>
<p>At Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a
vast multitude of similar works of art: and then besides, the
inattention to these matters that is induced by such vast numbers
of duties and so many items of business, quite precludes
the generality of persons from devoting their thoughts to the
subject. For, in fact, the admiration that is due to this art,
not only demands an abundance of leisure, but requires that
profound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence the artist
is now forgotten, who executed the statue of Venus that
was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in his Temple of
Peace, a work well worthy of the high repute of ancient times.
With reference, too, to the Dying Children of Niobe, in the
Temple of the Sosian Apollo, there is an equal degree of
uncertainty, whether it is the work of Scopas or of Praxiteles.</p>
<p>Scopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis, Timotheus
and Leochares, artists whom we are bound to mention
together, from the fact that they worked together at the Mausoleum
in Halicarnassus, such being the name of the tomb
that was erected by his wife Artemisia in honor of Mausolus,
a petty king of Caria, who died in the second year of the hundred
and seventh Olympiad. Through the exertions of these
artists more particularly, this work came to be reckoned one
of the Seven Wonders of the World. The circumference of
this building is, in all, four hundred and forty feet, and the
breadth from north to south sixty-three, the other two fronts
being not so wide in extent. It is twenty-five cubits in
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
height, and is surrounded with six-and-thirty columns, the
outer circumference being known as the &ldquo;Pteron,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wing.&rdquo;
The east side was sculptured by Scopas, the north by Bryaxis,
the south by Timotheus, and the west by Leochares; but,
before their task was completed, Queen Artemisia died.
They did not leave their work, however, until it was finished,
considering that it was at once a memorial of their own fame
and of the sculptor&rsquo;s art: and even to this day, it is undecided
which of them has excelled. A fifth artist also took
part in the work; for above the Pteron there is erected a
pyramid equal in height to the building below, and formed of
four-and-twenty steps, which gradually taper upwards towards
the summit; a platform, crowned with a representation of a
four-horse chariot by Pythis. This addition makes the total
height of the work one hundred and forty feet.</p>
<p>Beyond these, there are not many sculptors of high repute;
for, in the case of several works of very great excellence, the
number of artists that have been engaged upon them has
proved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individual
being able to engross the whole of the credit, and it
being impossible to award it in due proportion to the names
of the several artists combined. Such is the case with the
Laoco&ouml;n,<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a> for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus,
a work that may be looked upon as preferable to any other
production of the art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured
from a single block, both the main figure as well as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
children, and the serpents with their marvellous folds. This
group was made in concert by three most eminent artists,
Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus, natives of Rhodes.</p>
<h2 id="c120"><span class="large">CHAPTER XX.</span>
<br />OBELISKS.</h2>
<p>Thebaic stone, which is sprinkled all over with spots like
gold, is found in Africa, adjacent to Egypt; being peculiarly
adapted, from its natural properties, for the manufacture of
hones. In the neighborhood of Syene, too, in Thebais,
there is a stone found that is now known as syenite, but was
formerly called red-spotted granite.</p>
<p>Monarchs have entered into a sort of rivalry with one
another in forming elongated blocks of this stone, known as
obelisks,<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a> and consecrated to the divinity of the Sun. The
blocks had this form given to them in resemblance to the rays
of that luminary, which are so called<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a> in the Egyptian language.</p>
<p>Mesphres, who reigned in the City of the Sun, Heliopolis,
was the first who erected one of these obelisks, being warned
to do so in a dream: and there is an inscription upon the
obelisk to this effect.</p>
<p>At a later period other kings had these obelisks hewn.
Sesosthes erected four of them in the above-named city,
forty-eight cubits in height. Rhamsesis, too, who was reigning
at the time of the capture of Troy, erected one, a hundred
and forty cubits high. Having quitted the spot where the
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
palace of Apis stood, this monarch erected another obelisk,
one hundred and twenty cubits in height, but of prodigious
thickness, the sides being no less than eleven cubits in
breadth. It is said that one hundred and twenty thousand
men were employed upon this work;<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a> and that the king,
when it was on the point of being elevated, being apprehensive
that the machinery employed might not prove strong
enough for the weight, with the view of increasing the peril
that might be entailed by due want of precaution on the part
of the workmen, had his own son fastened to the summit; in
order that the safety of the prince might at the same time
ensure the safety of the mass of stone. It was in his admiration
of this work, that, when King Cambyses took the city by
storm, and the conflagration had already reached the very
foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire to be extinguished; for
he entertained a respect for this stupendous erection which he
had not entertained for the city itself.</p>
<p>Ptolem&aelig;us Philadelphus erected at Alexandria an obelisk
eighty cubits high, which had been prepared by order of King
Necthebis: it was without any inscription, and cost far more
trouble in its carriage and elevation, than had been originally
expended in quarrying it. Some writers inform us that it was
conveyed on a raft, under the inspection of the architect
Satyrus. For this purpose, a canal was dug from the river
Nile to the spot where the obelisk lay; and two broad vessels,
laden with blocks of similar stone a foot square, the cargo of
each amounting to double the size, and consequently double
the weight, of the obelisk, were brought beneath it; the
extremities of the obelisk remaining supported by the opposite
sides of the canal. The blocks of stone were then
removed, and the vessels being thus gradually lightened,
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
received their burden. It was erected upon a basis of six
square blocks, quarried from the same mountain, and the artist
was rewarded with the sum of fifty talents. This obelisk was
placed by the king above-mentioned in the Arsino&oelig;um,<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a> in
testimony of his affection for his wife and sister Arsino&euml;. At
a later period, as it was found to be an inconvenience to the
docks, Maximus, then pr&aelig;fect of Egypt, had it transferred
to the Forum there, after removing the summit for the purpose
of substituting a gilded point, an intention which was
ultimately abandoned.</p>
<p>There are two other obelisks, which were in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
Temple at Alexandria, near the harbor, forty-two cubits in
height, and originally hewn by order of King Mesphres. But
the most difficult enterprise of all was the carriage of these
obelisks by sea to Rome, in vessels which excited the greatest
admiration. Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecrated
the one which brought over the first obelisk, as a lasting
memorial of this marvellous undertaking, in the docks at
Puteoli; but it was destroyed by fire. The one in which, by
order of the Emperor Caius, the other obelisk had been
transported to Rome, after having been preserved for some
years and looked upon as the most wonderful construction
ever beheld upon the seas, was brought to Ostia, by order of
the late Emperor Claudius; and towers of Puteolan earth
being first erected upon it, it was sunk for the construction of
the harbor which he was making there. And then, besides,
there was the necessity of constructing other vessels to carry
these obelisks up the Tiber; by which it became practically
ascertained, that the depth of water in that river is not less
than that of the river Nile.</p>

<h2 id="c121">CONCLUSION.
<br />ITALY.</h2>
<p>Having now treated of all the works of Nature, let me end
with a word about our native land. Throughout the whole
earth, wherever the vault of heaven extends, there is no
country so beautiful, or which, for the productions of Nature,
merits so high a rank as Italy, that ruler and second parent of
the world; recommended as she is by her men, her women,
her generals, her soldiers, her slaves, her superiority in the
arts, and the illustrious examples of genius which she has
produced. Her situation, too, is equally in her favor; the
salubrity and mildness of her climate; the easy access which
she offers to all nations; her coasts indented with so many
harbors; the propitious breezes that ever prevail on her
shores; advantages, all of them, due to her situation, lying as
she does, midway between the East and the West. Add to
this, the abundant supply of her waters, the salubrity of her
groves, the repeated intersections of her mountain ranges, the
comparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the fertility of
her soil, and the singular richness of her pastures. In short,
whatever there is that can minister comfort to the life of man
is nowhere else to be found in greater perfection. The
cereals, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissues, and oxen&mdash;the finest are
here. No horses are preferred to those of Italy for the
course; while in mines of gold, silver, copper, and iron, Italy
is held inferior to no country whatsoever. Ever teeming with
these treasures, she lavishes upon us all her bounties of land
and sea.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hail</span> to thee, Nature, thou parent of all things! and do
thou deign to show thy favor unto me, who, alone of all the
citizens of Rome, have, in thy every department, thus made
known thy praise.</p>

friezes and walls at Pompeii. In the East, where there were no safe places
of deposit for money, it was the custom to bury it in the earth; hence, for the
purpose of scaring depredators, the story was carefully circulated that hidden
treasures were guarded by serpents and dragons. There can be little doubt
that these stories, on arriving in the western world, combined with the knowledge
of the existence of gold in the Uralian chain and other mountains of the
East, gave rise to the stories of the Griffins and the Arimaspi. It has been
suggested that the Arimaspi were no other than the modern Tsheremis, who
dwelt on the left bank of the Middle Volga, not far from the gold districts of
the Uralian range. It has been conjectured, that the fabulous tales of the
combats of the Arimaspi with the Griffins, were invented by the neighboring
tribes of the Essedones, who were anxious to throw a mystery over the origin
of the gold, that they might preserve the traffic in their own hands. The
Altai Mountains, in the north of Asia, contain many gold mines, which are
still worked, as well as traces of former workings.

but to the mechanical construction of the part. The Indians, from whom we
presume that Pliny derived his account, have always regarded the elephant
with a kind of superstitious veneration.

this animal, as by nature it is taught to imitate every action, and to take to
flight by climbing up trees. When the hunters see an ape sitting on a tree,
they place within sight of it a dish full of water, with which they rub their
eyes; and then slyly substituting another in its place, full of bird-lime, retire
and keep upon the watch. The animal comes down from the tree, and rubs
its eyes with the bird-lime, in consequence of which the eyelids stick together,
and it is unable to escape.&rdquo; &AElig;lian also says, Hist. Anim. B. xvii. c. 25, that
the hunters pretend to put on their shoes, and then substitute, in their place,
shoes of lead; the animal attempts to imitate them, and, the shoes being so
contrived, when it has once got them on, it finds itself unable to take them
off, or to move, and is consequently taken.

ancient and modern, had been adduced, in proof that such was the
fact. He says that this was the belief of Scaliger, and quotes the book of
Aldrovandus on Monsters. But, as Cuvier remarks, it is impossible to explain
these stories of nereids and tritons, on any other grounds than the fraudulent
pretences of those who have exhibited them, or asserted that they have
seen them. &ldquo;It was only last year,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that all London was resorting
to see a wonderful sight in what is commonly called a mermaid. I myself had
the opportunity of examining a very similar object: it was the body of a child,
in the mouth of which they had introduced the jaws of a sparus, or &lsquo;gilt-head,&rsquo;
while for the legs was substituted the body of a lizard.&rdquo; &ldquo;The body of the
London mermaid,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was that of an ape, and a fish attached to it supplied
the place of the hind legs.&rdquo;

was able to bear ten men on its back. He also tells us of a much more

tastes of the Romans. He says: &ldquo;A mullet even, if just caught, is
thought little of, unless it is allowed to die in the hand of your guest. They
are carried about enclosed in globes of glass, and their color is watched as
they die&mdash;ever changing by the struggles of death into various shades and
hues.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;There is nothing, you say, more beautiful than the
colors of the dying mullet; as it struggles and breathes forth its life, it is first
purple, and then a paleness gradually comes over it; and then, placed as it is
between life and death, an uncertain hue comes over it.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_136" href="#fr_136">[136]</a>Seneca speaks of this cruel custom of pickling fish alive. &ldquo;Other fish,
again, they kill in sauces, and pickle them alive. There are some persons
who look upon it as quite incredible that a fish should be able to live underground.
How much more so would it appear to them, if they were to hear of
a fish swimming in sauce, and that the chief dish of the banquet was killed at
the banquet, feeding the eye before it does the gullet?&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_137" href="#fr_137">[137]</a>Juvenal, Sat. iv. l. 15, speaks of a mullet being bought for 6000 sesterces,
a thousand for every pound, and Suetonius tells us that in the reign of Tiberius
three mullets were sold for 30,000 sesterces. It is in allusion to this kind
of extravagance that Juvenal says, in the same Satire, that it is not unlikely
that the fisherman could be bought as a slave for a smaller sum than the fish
itself. At the above rate, each of these mullets sold for nearly $400 of our
money.

else but a diversion, so to speak, of the juices, whose duty it is to line the
interior of the shell, to thicken and so amplify it; and consequently, the pearl
is the result of some malady. It is possible for them to be found in all shell-fish;
but they have no beauty in them, unless the interior of the shell, or, as
we call it, the mother-of-pearl, is lustrous and beautiful itself. Hence the
finest of them come from the east, and are furnished by the kind of bivalve,
called by Linn&aelig;us, &ldquo;Mytilus margaritiferus,&rdquo; which has the most beautiful
mother-of-pearl in the interior that is known. The parts of the Indian sea
which are mentioned by Pliny, are those in which the pearl oyster is still found
in the greatest abundance.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_143" href="#fr_143">[143]</a>Procopius tells a wonderful story in relation to this subject. He says,
that the sea-dogs are wonderful admirers of the pearl-fish, and follow them out
to sea; that when the sea-dogs are pressed by hunger, they go in quest of
prey, and then return to the shell-fish and gaze upon it. A certain fisherman,
having watched for the moment when the shell-fish was deprived of the protection
of its attendant sea-dog, which was seeking its prey, seized the shell-fish,
and made for the shore. The sea-dog, however, was soon aware of the
theft, and making straight for the fisherman, seized him. Finding himself
thus caught, he made a last effort, and threw the pearl-fish on shore, upon
which he was immediately torn to pieces by its protector.

the workmanship of Praxiteles.

Rome, with no other covering than a goat&rsquo;s skin tied about the loins.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_213" href="#fr_213">[213]</a>Pliny has forgotten the gilded chariot, with six horses, which Cneius Cornelius
dedicated in the Capitol, two hundred years before Augustus; there is
also an ancient inscription which mentions chariots of this description.

were the Roman numerals for the figures in question.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_216" href="#fr_216">[216]</a>The Colossus at Rhodes was begun by Chares, but he committed suicide,
in consequence of having made some mistake in the estimate; the work was
completed by Laches, also an inhabitant of Lindos.</div>
<div class="fncont">It remained on the spot where it was thrown down for nearly nine hundred
years, until the year 653 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, when Moavia, khalif of the Saracens, after the
capture of Rhodes, sold the materials; it is said that it required nine hundred
camels to remove the pieces.</div>
<div class="fncont">The Bartholdi statue of &ldquo;Liberty enlightening the World&rdquo; is even larger
than the Colossus at Rhodes.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_217" href="#fr_217">[217]</a>St. Jerome informs us, that Vespasian removed the head of Nero, and
substituted that of the Sun with seven rays.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_218" href="#fr_218">[218]</a>There is no work of Phidias now in existence; the sculptures in the
Parthenon were, however, executed by his pupils and under his immediate
directions, so that we may form some judgment of his genius and taste.
There is a foot in the British Museum, said to be the work of Phidias.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_219" href="#fr_219">[219]</a>Praxiteles held a high rank among the ancient sculptors, and may be considered
as second to Phidias alone.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_220" href="#fr_220">[220]</a>Pliny has here confounded two artists of the same name; the Polycletus
who was the successor of Phidias, and was not much inferior to him in merit,
and Polycletus of Argos, who lived 160 years later, and who also executed
many capital works, some of which are here mentioned. It appears that Cicero,
Vitruvius, Strabo, Quintilian, Plutarch, and Lucian have also confounded
these two artists; but Pausanias, who is very correct in the account which he
gives us of all subjects connected with works of art, was aware of the distinction;
and it is from his observations that we have been enabled to correct the
error into which so many eminent writers had fallen.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_221" href="#fr_221">[221]</a>Myron was born at Eleuther&aelig;, in B&oelig;otia; but having been presented by

was always designated an Athenian.

would allow his portrait to be painted by no one except Apelles, nor his
statue to be made by any one except Lysippus.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_225" href="#fr_225">[225]</a>Two copies of this Ganymede are still in existence at Rome.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_226" href="#fr_226">[226]</a>There were two artists of this name, both natives of Samos. This one

class of painters, in contradistinction to the stylus or cestrum used for spreading
the wax-colors. Painters with the brush used what we should term
&ldquo;water-colors;&rdquo; oil-colors, in our sense of the word, being unknown to the
ancients.

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_235" href="#fr_235">[235]</a>Dr. Smith says: &ldquo;The most natural explanation of this difficult passage
seems to be, that down the middle of the first line of Apelles, Protogenes
drew another, so as to divide it into two parallel halves, and that Apelles
again divided the line of Protogenes in the same manner.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_236" href="#fr_236">[236]</a>The Latin form of which, as given by Erasmus, is &ldquo;Nulla dies abeat

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_240" href="#fr_240">[240]</a>Sir Joshua Reynolds discovers in the account here given &ldquo;an artist-like

Titian and the rest of the Venetian painters.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_241" href="#fr_241">[241]</a>A service of three dishes.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_242" href="#fr_242">[242]</a>The ancient writers abound in praises of this wonderful statue. Lucian,
however, has given the most complete and artistic description of it. It was
supposed by the ancients, to represent Venus as standing before Paris, when
he awarded to her the prize of beauty; but it has been well remarked, that the
drapery in the right hand, and the vase by the side of the figure, indicate that
she has either just left or is about to enter the bath. It was ultimately carried
to Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the reign of Justinian. It is
doubtful whether there are any copies of it in existence. There is, however,
a so-called copy in the gardens of the Vatican, and another in the Glyptothek,
at Munich. It is supposed that Cleomenes, in making the Venus de Medici,
imitated the Cnidian Venus in some degree.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_243" href="#fr_243">[243]</a>This group is generally supposed to have been identical with the Laoco&ouml;n
still to be seen in the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at Rome; having
been found, in 1506, in a vault beneath the spot known as the Place <i>de Sette
Sale</i>, by Felix de Eredi, who surrendered it, in consideration of a pension, to
Pope Julius II. The group, however, is not made of a <i>single</i> block, which has
caused some to doubt its identity: but it is not improbable, that when originally
made, its joints were not perceptible to a common observer. The spot,
too, where it was found was actually part of the palace of Titus. It is most
probable that the artists had the beautiful episode of Laoco&ouml;n in view, as
penned by Virgil, &AElig;n. B. II.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_244" href="#fr_244">[244]</a>So called from <span title="obeliskos" class="g">&#8000;&beta;&epsilon;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf;</span>, a &ldquo;small spit,&rdquo; in consequence of their tapering
form.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_245" href="#fr_245">[245]</a>Meaning, probably, that in the Egyptian language, the same word is used
as signifying a &ldquo;spit&rdquo; and a &ldquo;ray&rdquo; of light; for it is generally agreed that
the word &ldquo;obeliscus&rdquo; is of Greek origin.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_246" href="#fr_246">[246]</a>This, Hardouin says, was the same obelisk that was afterwards erected
by Constantine, son of Constantine the Great, in the Circus Maximus at Rome;
whence it was removed by Pope Sextus V., in the year 1588, to the Basilica of
the Lateran.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_247" href="#fr_247">[247]</a>Evidently a stupendous monument, or rather aggregate of buildings,
erected by Ptolemy II., Philadelphus, in memory of his wife and sister, Arsino&euml;.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
